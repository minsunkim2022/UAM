Several eVTOL aircraft propelled using Lithium-ion batteries are under development. However, despite the early spotlight, the manufacturers need to ensure safe long-term operation of the vehicles including strict checks on battery-related hazards. On the other hand, fast charging of eVTOL batteries is crucial to enable multiple flights per day and justify the economics of UAM. This work is aimed at contextualising battery safety for eVTOL through the modification of a battery fault diagnosis algorithm for fast charging. The algorithm was developed in Parts 1 and 2 of the paper to use the charging cycle data for detecting disconnection faults but tested only for low charging currents. This paper adapts the algorithm for fast charging through a novel technique termed as Partial Incremental Capacity (PIC). The PIC method was developed using experiments at single cell and supercell level before integrating it into the algorithm. Finally, the fault detection ability of the adapted algorithm was validated using a real-life eVTOL battery module. Thus, the updated version of the algorithm facilitates fault diagnosis while charging fast, making it ideal for implementation in eVTOL. © 2023 The Authors","Electric aircraft; eVTOL; Fast charging; Fault diagnosis; Incremental capacity; Li-ion batteries"

These systems usually integrate multiple sensors to improve navigation accuracy and require the corresponding integrity monitoring architecture to ensure integrity. In response, we implement the Solution Separation-based Kalman filter integrity monitoring (SS-KFIM) technique to achieve fault detection and protection level evaluation for multi-sensor integrated navigation. In our implementation, the filter bank management strategies to handle sensor-in and sensor-out events are discussed. Besides, we consider the faults in state initialization and propagation phases aside from those at the measurement-update stage. Furthermore, our implementation can accommodate the cases where the all-in-view filter is not optimal in a least-squares sense. Simulations are conducted with an illustrative example where an inertial navigation system, global navigation satellite systems, and visual odometry are integrated for a UAM task. The results prove the high effectiveness and extended applicability of our implementation of the SS-KFIM algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Integrity monitoring; Kalman filter; Multi-sensor integrated navigation; Solution separation"

Researching the intention to use air vehicles is not easy, as it is a new mode of transport that has not yet been implemented, so there are no available observed data. This fact is why the many gaps and uncertainties remain unexplored in academic research on this topic. The most critical issues for the successful implementation of a UAM transport system is public acceptance and user adoption. Based on technology adoption theories, this paper investigates critical constructs in generating usage intention to use urban air autonomous vehicles (UAAVs) and the mediator role of pro-environmental behavior and human values in this relationship. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used with a sample from the US and China. The results confirm that attitudes, performance expectancy, and social influence reinforce the intention to use UAAVs, while anxiety reduces it. The UAAV acceptance model is very similar between the Chinese and US populations. The only difference between the two samples is that social influence has a positive and significant effect on intention to use among US people. At the same time, this variable is not essential in the Chinese sample. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Covariance-based structural equation modeling; Human values; Intention to use; Pro-environmental behavior; Urban air autonomous vehicles"

To mimic the atmospheric flow with realism, large-eddy simulation was employed along with an immersed boundary method to construct the presence of the building arrays. Four cases were studied which included an array of three high-rise buildings and three other combinations of high-rise and low-rise building arrays. Horseshoe vortex and recirculation flows were found in all building configurations whose intensity varied according to the upstream building height. In particular, the clockwise-rotating vortex was found to be dominant within the cavity between the buildings. In addition, the lateral vortex generated by the side walls of the non-uniform array tilted outward due to the secondary flow formed by the wake of the building, which additionally contributed to the downwash flow behind the building array. Elevated velocity fluctuations were found on top of and behind the high-rise buildings which persisted further downstream in parallel with the freestream flow. The largest velocity standard deviation was found to be 3.8 times that of the inflow which was due to the combination of flow recirculation and the wake from the further upstream building. Finally, the velocity spectra were analyzed to provide reference data for the deployment of vertiports and the UAM take-off and landing guidance. © 2023","Atmospheric boundary layer; Building arrangement; Large eddy simulation; Urban air mobility"

However, in addition to the safe design of vehicles, efficient operation must also be achieved by matching passenger requests to unoccupied and suitable vehicles. In the agent-based transportation simulation MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation), a rule-based approach has been followed by assigning the nearest available vehicle to each passenger request. Sophisticated considerations such as pooling multiple passengers with identical trip requests in terms of time and location or the urgency of a request were only partially considered or not considered at all. To decrease operating costs, especially by reducing the number of passenger flights and avoiding relocation flights, appropriate dispatching is essential for efficient assignment of available vehicles to trip requests. For this purpose, the suitability of the Bipartite Matching Dispatcher (BMD), already proven for ground-based on-demand mobility concepts, was investigated for application to UAM systems by demonstrating its performance on an existing data set using a mock-up simulation and comparing it to the initial dispatcher in MATSim. Studies have not only shown the similarity between UAM and ground-based on-demand operations, but also the compatibility of BMD for high load traffic scenarios with undersized fleets. Insights on the impact of available information, for example, the prioritization of early-submitted requests over urgent requests, on the operator's point of view can be concluded. For an efficient vehicle assignment, the consideration of passengers’ attitude towards possible comfort restrictions due to longer waiting times and incentives through price adjustments is of crucial importance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dispatching; Transportation simulation; Urban air mobility; Vehicle assignment"

The selected circular image feature decouples the position and attitude of UAM, so an image-based impedance control is proposed to control the position and track the contact force. The developed controller uses geometric methods to control the attitude. In addition, the designed aerial manipulator decouples the roll and pitch of the UAV from the UAV, which improves the system's stability.

This framework is applied to a conceptual UAM airspace configuration, where a free-flight-based routing service and a corridor-based routing service are dynamically allocated to control different portions of the airspace over time, based on traffic demand. This allocation seeks to determine the least amount of structured coordination (in terms of active flight corridors) needed to safely meet traffic demand. This framework integrates several modeling components, including a novel spatiotemporal graph theoretic UAM traffic model capable of optimizing vehicle trajectories while maintaining multiple flight constraints. Airspace complexity and trajectory efficiency metrics are both implemented to quantify the overall safety and cumulative cost of routing a set of missions according to a given airspace configuration. Finally, spatial airspace partitions are managed using a support vector machine-based algorithm. Metrics are then applied to optimize the airspace configurations, according to desired objectives. Simulated results show that this framework can produce airspace configurations that ensure safety, while providing trajectory efficiency more effectively than purely uniform free-flight or corridor-based flight. This is demonstrated for both low-and high-density traffic scenarios. © 2023, AIAA International. All rights reserved.",

For the S.S. calculations, a sample of 500 DeCART multi-group cross section sets for two major actinides, i.e., 235U and 238U, were generated by the MIG code and covariance data from the ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluated nuclear data library. In the three pin problems (i.e. TMI-1, PB2, and Koz-6) from the UAM benchmark, the uncertainties in kinf by the DeCART/MIG S.S. calculations agreed very well with the sensitivity and uncertainty (S/U) perturbation results by DeCART/MUSAD and the S/U direct subtraction (S/U-DS) results by the DeCART/MIG. From these results, it was concluded that the multi-group cross section sampling module of the MIG code works correctly and accurately. In the BEAVRS whole benchmark problems, the uncertainties in the control rod bank worth, isothermal temperature coefficient, power distribution, and critical boron concentration due to cross section uncertainties were calculated by the DeCART/MIG code system. Overall, the uncertainties in these design parameters were less than the general design review criteria of a typical pressurized water reactor start-up case. This newly-developed DeCART/MIG UQ analysis code system by the S.S. method can be widely utilized as uncertainty analysis and margin estimation tools for developing and designing new advanced nuclear reactors. © 2023 Korean Nuclear Society","BEAVRS; Cross section sampling; DeCART; MIG; Stochastic sampling; UAM; Uncertainty quantification"

Throughout the twentieth century, there was copious debate surrounding the rights of property owners and the authority of aviation regulatory agencies to govern airspace. The invention of the airplane and a burgeoning concern about aerial trespass vigorously fueled that debate. In the contemporary context, airspace ownership questions center primarily on debates over low-altitude airspace and subsequent legal remedies available for improper use, illegal entrance, or unwanted occupation of that airspace. This review examines the history of airspace ownership controversies in the United States through an analysis of legal cases, scholarly debates, academic journal articles, and primary sources. The purpose of this paper is to assist aviation scholarly and industry personnel in forming a better understanding of the historical and contemporary debates that have surrounded the question of airspace rights. It is a particularly meaningful time to review this area of aviation legal history because the advent of novel aviation technologies—namely, drones, Urban Air Mobility (UAM), and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) air taxis—is creating an industry ripe for new airspace ownership and control controversies in the coming decades. © 2023, University Aviation Association.

Using the UAM-AUM scale we apply structural equation modelling analysis for model validation based on data collected from 348 participants and the results strongly support the proposed model. Perceived usefulness is found to be the strongest determinant of user behavioural intention and mediates the effects of UAM acceptance, influencing the intention to use the system along with other variables. Another critical factor for promoting consumers’ positive intentions towards UAM system use is general reliability.

The UAM and LAM are divided into multiple sections, in which the hybrid structures combining cascaded Helmholtz resonators and a straight pipe are adopted to achieve specific phase compensation. By rotating the UAM, the incident acoustic plane wave can be efficiently converted into the vortex acoustic waves of reconfigurable topological charges ranging from -5 to +5 with distinguishable purity. Furthermore, the influences of the parameters on the purity of the generated topological charges have been investigated and discussed, such as the distance between LAM and UAM, rotatable angle error, and operating frequency. With the capability of reconfigurable OAM modes, the proposed DAM can be used to efficiently increase capacity or to conveniently switch between different channels in underwater vortex acoustic communications. © 2023 Author(s).",

In this perspective, this study investigates the Environmental Life Cycle Costs of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) services to evaluate their potential integration with other transport systems, in the three-time horizons (2025, 2030, 2035). The key area of research was focused on the determination of the cost components of UAM required to calculate the unit costs of UAM transportation. To this end, unitary data and the method from a 2017 EC DG MOVE's report on urban accessibility have been adopted. The analysis confirms that most of the cost is related to the aircraft energy consumption during flight, while the rest is used by ground infrastructure. Moreover, the energy cost is strongly correlated with the distance travelled and the size of the aircraft. The longer the flight and the bigger the aircraft, the higher is the energy cost. Complex cost analysis should be able to support decision-makers in the definition of Sustainable Urban Mobility and their principles of integration, participation, monitoring and evaluation.

Artificial intelligence, a camera sensor, an embedded board, and an LED marine lantern were used to conduct the research. A deep learning-based dehaze model was learned by collecting real marine environment and open haze image data sets. By applying this learned model to the original hazy images, we obtained clear dehaze images. Comparing those two images, the concentration level of sea fog was derived into the PSNR and SSIM values. The brightness of the marine lantern was controlled through serial communication with the derived PSNR and SSIM values in a realized sea fog environment. As a result, it was possible to autonomously control the brightness of the marine lantern according to the concentration of sea fog, unlike the current marine lanterns, which adjust their brightness manually. This novel-developed lantern can efficiently utilize power consumption while enhancing its visibility. This method can be used for other fog concentration estimation systems at the embedded board level, so that applicable for local weather expectations, UAM navigation, and autonomous driving for marine ships. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; computer vision; deep learning; dehaze; embedded system; LED marine lantern; sea fog; serial communication"

A survey was carried out in Portugal of the citizens with a view to better understanding their attitude towards such a goal. The survey revealed a positive attitude towards the use of drones in city logistics and that socio-demographic characteristics, namely gender, education level, job occupation, age, and home location are not directly correlated with citizens’ attitudes.

Two-way ranging (TWR) is often considered a poor positioning solution for airborne and other vehicular navigation systems due to its low precision, poor angular resolution, and precise timing requirements. With the advent of modern RF hardware and advanced processing techniques, however, modern studies have experimentally demonstrated TWR systems with an unprecedented, sub-centimeter ranging precision with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) consumer-grade hardware. This technique enables a new class of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities for urban and commercial aircraft but also instigates new system design challenges such as antenna placement, installation of new electronics, and design of supporting infrastructure. To inform these aircraft design decisions, we derive 2D and 3D Cramér–Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on position and orientation estimation in a multi-antenna TWR system. We specifically formulate these bounds as a function of the number of antennas, platform geometry, and geometric dilution of precision (GDoP) to inform aircraft design decisions under different mission requirements.

The demand and capacity balancing (DCB) issue, separation conflict, and block unavailability introduced by wind turbulence are resolved by the proposed the multi-agent asynchronous advantage actor-critic (MAA3C) framework, in which the recurrent actor-critic networks allow the automatic action selection between ground delay, speed adjustment, and flight cancellation. The learned parameters in MAA3C are replaced with random values to compare the performance of trained models. Simulated training and test experiments performed on a small urban prototype and various combined use cases suggest the superiority of the MAA3C solution in resolving conflicts with complicated wind fields. And the generalization, scalability, and stability of the model are also demonstrated while applying the model to complex environments. © 2023, The Author(s).","Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Strategic conflict management; Urban air mobility; Wind turbulence"

In the mobility sector, technology adoption and its sustainable integration into current transport systems strongly depend on citizens' perspectives both as users and non-users. Following a bottom-up approach originating from the societal views, this study analyses the attitude of citizens towards Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and brings insights into the citizens' expectations of the role that UAM can play in inhabited environments. The views of 485 residents of Lisbon in Portugal were collected to address aspects of UAM receptiveness. Six clusters of citizens were obtained expressing different attitudes towards UAM: open-minded, pollution sensitive, first movers, emergency supporters, skepticals and deniers. The designated clusters require different policies and practices from the side of policymakers and transport operators. The results indicate that positive attitudes towards UAM are characterized by higher intention to use such services suggesting that actions need to be taken to better comprehend each cluster's expectations.

Furthermore, cameras are usually treated by pairs, obtaining local solutions, rather than finding a global solution at once for all multiple cameras. Other key issue is that of the affinity function: the widespread usage of non-learnable pre-defined distances, such as the Euclidean and Cosine ones. This paper proposes an effective approach for cross-camera data-association focused on a global solution, instead of processing cameras by pairs. To avoid the usage of fixed distances and thresholds, we leverage the connectivity of Graph Neural Networks, previously unused in this scope, using a Message Passing Network to jointly learn features and similarity functions. We validate the proposal for pedestrian cross-camera association, showing results over the EPFL multi-camera pedestrian dataset. Our approach considerably outperforms the literature data association techniques, without requiring to be trained in the same scenario in which it is tested.

Luminescence spectroscopy showed emission by Ag₂BDC, which was attributed to ligand-to-metal or ligand-to-metal–metal transitions, suggesting energy transfer due to the short distance between adjacent BDC molecules. UAM-1 and UAM-2 did not show luminescence emission attributable to ligand-to-metal transition; rather, they presented only UV emission.

Once oil leakage occurs, it indicates that some faults may happen and even affect the normal operation of high-speed trains, thus posing a threat to the safety of the train. Therefore, we can detect the oil stains to discover leaks or find some faults in these components to eliminate potential threats in time. Oil stains have the properties of irregular shapes and huge differences in size, and the internal environment of the train is complex and composed of various parts so it is difficult to detect oil stains. This paper proposes a novel methodology to detect oil stains, named Progressive Context Comprehension Network(PCCN). The Upsampling Augmentation Module(UAM) and Feature Refinement Module(FRM) are proposed to augment features by strengthening the long short-term contextual relationship of features from multi-levels. The Pyramid Context Fusion Module(PCFM) is proposed to fuse features by progressively integrating adjacent features, which makes features of each level richer. Moreover, a loss function is applied to instruct the network to learn the characteristics of oil stains in the case of extremely uneven distribution of oil stains and background. Experiment results show that our network achieves better performance such as mIoU and F1-Score with a minimal number of parameters and FLOPs than advanced semantic segmentation methods. Besides, we apply our proposed network to five public saliency datasets and achieve better performance, which demonstrates the adaptability and effectiveness of our method as well.

We characterised people who injected drugs (PWID) in England and Wales who had insufficient NS in the past month to meet their injecting requirements. Methods: This study utilised 2017–2019 data from the annual Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring (UAM) Survey of PWID recruited through specialist services. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with inadequate NS coverage. Findings: Of 2,442 PWID surveyed who had injected in the past month, 34% reported inadequate NS coverage (or as high as 51% if including unsuccessful injections). Younger PWID (adjusted odds ratio: 2.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.35–3.52), those who began injecting in the past three years (1.46, 1.09–2.00), and those who reported sharing injecting equipment (1.46, 1.22–1.75) had greater odds of having inadequate NS coverage. PWID currently prescribed Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST) had lower odds of inadequate NS coverage (0.60, 0.49–0.73).

Urban air mobility vehicles are primarily based on fully electrical flight control systems with rotary output. Since such technology is relatively new and unproven, Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) algorithms, able to continuously monitor the health status of such systems, are of particular interest. The diffusion of these systems strongly depends on the general confidence of possible customers.

In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as <italic>corridors</italic>, that link the aerodromes, thus avoiding the use of complex routing strategies such as those of modern-day helicopters and alleviating the burden on the ground transportation system. For safety, a UAM aircraft must use air-to-ground communications to report flight plan, off-nominal events, and real-time movement to ground base stations (GBSs). A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a suitable spatial model is proposed. For the considered setup, assuming that any given aircraft communicates with the closest GBS, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft&#x2019;s turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines.

To support this emerging aviation application, concepts for UAS/UAM traffic management (UTM) systems have been explored. Accurately characterizing and predicting the microscale weather conditions, winds in particular, will be critical to safe and efficient operations of the small UASs/UAM aircrafts within the UTM. This study implements a reduced order data assimilation approach to reduce discrepancies between the predicted urban wind speed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model with real-world, limited and sparse observations. The developed data assimilation system is UrbanDA. These observations are simulated using a large eddy simulation (LES). The data assimilation approach is based on the time-independent variational framework and uses space reduction to reduce the memory cost of the process. This approach leads to error reduction throughout the simulated domain and the reconstructed field is different than the initial guess by ingesting wind speeds at sensor locations and hence taking into account flow unsteadiness in a time when only the mean flow quantities are resolved. Different locations where wind sensors can be installed are discussed in terms of their impact on the resulting wind field. It is shown that near-wall locations, near turbulence generation areas with high wind speeds have the highest impact. Approximating the model error with its principal mode provides a better agreement with the truth and the hazardous areas for UAS navigation increases by more than 10% as wind hazards resulting from buildings wakes are better simulated through this process. © 2023 The Author(s)","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Data Assimilation; Model Reduction; Principal Component Analysis; Urban Air Mobility; Variational Data Assimilation"

In this paper, we consider an air transportation system where multiple AVs are operated to transport passengers or cargo from different sources to destinations along their pre-defined paths. During the flight, the minimum communication Quality of Service (QoS) must be achieved at all times to ensure flight safety. Our objective is to minimize the total mission completion time by jointly optimizing the velocities and spectrum allocation for all AVs. We formulate the optimization problem as a multi-stage Markov game where the optimization variables are coupled together. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning VD3QN algorithm is proposed to enable cooperative learning among AVs.

However, the sparsity and unbalanced distribution of ships in SAR images mean that most anchor boxes are redundant. Thus, the anchor settings directly affect the performance and generalization ability of the detector. In addition, a variety in ship scales and the substantial interference of inshore backgrounds bring significant challenges to the SAR ship detector's performance improvement. In this letter, a novel anchor-free-based detector, named feature balance and united attention (FBUA-Net), is proposed. We adopt a keypoint-based strategy to predict bounding boxes to eliminate the influence of anchors. Besides, we propose a global context-guided feature balanced pyramid (GC-FBP), which balances the semantic information at different levels of the feature pyramid by aggregation and averaging and uses the global context module (GCM) to learn global contextual information to construct long-range dependencies between ship targets and the background.

Existing methods using one-way time-of-arrival measurements require anchors to be synchronized and the agent&#x2019;s motion to be modeled with a constant velocity. However, the requirement of synchronization between anchors limits the flexibility and scalability of IoT networks. Moreover, existing methods are inapplicable for agents that perform arbitrary motions. In this study, we developed a set of methods to solve the JLAS problem in asynchronous networks. First, we modelled the motion of the moving agent and classified it into two categories, acceleration and time-varying motion. We showed that the existing modeling motion is a special case of acceleration motion. Second, for the case of acceleration motion with priori information, we proposed the optimal JLAS method, namely, JLAS-KAM, to compensate for the movement-caused estimation error. Next, we developed a maximum likelihood estimator, namely, JLAS-UAM, to jointly estimate the position, velocity, and acceleration of the agent in the absence of priori information. Third, for the case of time-varying motion, we developed the optimal JLAS method, namely, JLAS-TVM, to jointly estimate the agent position and velocity at each time instant. Moreover, iterative algorithms were proposed to solve optimization problems. We derived the Cramer-Rao lower bound for three proposed methods and analyzed their performance. Simulation results verified the theoretical analysis of the estimation performance and revealed the characteristics and advantages of the proposed methods.

At this time, Urban Air Mobility (UAM) can provide unmanned services such as delivery or taxis regardless of ground infrastructure. However, if there is a problem with the remote control or communication of UAM, there is a serious risk that can cause a lot of casualties immediately. Therefore, optimizing the trajectory of UAMs to avoid collisions between UAMs and ensure reliable communication is necessary. On the other hand, communication through satellites such as Starlink has the advantage of having wide coverage, so satellites can support communication services in areas where communication infrastructure is insufficient. Thus, in this paper, reliable communication of UAMs is funded through the satellite-air-terrestrial integrated network. At this time, each UAM considers the location of the communication infrastructure and other UAMs, avoids collisions, and derives a trajectory for reliable communication. We proposed an algorithm based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) to derive the optimal trajectory of UAMs in a short time.

The depletion study of the 15 × 15 PWR assembly using the SAMPLER and TRITON modules of the SCALE code system revealed a maximum uncertainty in keff of 0.49% for fresh fuel, decreasing to 0.38% at the midpoint of the fuel cycle and rising back to 0.48% at the end of the fuel cycle. Uncertainties and correlations of various homogenized cross sections and other group constant data, such as keff, have been determined, and the effect of randomly applied manufacturing uncertainties was found to be largely negligible relative to nuclear data uncertainties for bulk lattice parameters. However, for local parameters, such as the pin power factors, assembly discontinuity factors, and diffusion coefficients, the effects from manufacturing uncertainties were appreciable and sometimes dominant. Nuclear data uncertainties were found to be the dominant contributors to uncertainty in the isotopic composition of the overall assembly, with the exception of very early in the fuel cycle, where manufacturing uncertainties such as perturbations to the fuel density and pin radius made nonnegligible contributions to total uncertainty. The contribution of manufacturing uncertainties to isotopic uncertainties was nonnegligible at a pin-by-pin level, but still smaller than the contributions from nuclear data uncertainty. Studies of the PWR mini-core rod movement transient using homogenized data from the SCALE models in the PARCS diffusion code showed little difference between the tested modeling approaches and demonstrated that nuclear data uncertainties dominated the manufacturing uncertainties in the global figures of merit considered, such as the equilibrium core boron concentration, the maximum core power factor, and the maximum reactivity insertion. For local effects, such as maximum pin power during the transient, the randomly applied manufacturing uncertainties were dominant. It was found in general that for global system properties, nuclear data uncertainties made significantly larger contributions to total uncertainty, whereas for local parameters the impact of manufacturing uncertainties was at least nonnegligible, and for some parameters, dominant. © 2023 The Author(s).

The corresponding travel demand that can be potentially captured under each scenario is estimated with a home–workplace trip table. The results of the analyses indicate that supply-side infrastructure opportunities, such as heliports and elevated parking structures, are widely available to accommodate the regional deployment of UAM services.

This is because the use of digital twins in the operation and control of UAM vehicles is essential for the UAM operational digital twin infrastructure (UAM-ODT). There are several issues that need to be addressed in this process: (i) the lack of digital twin engines for the digitalization (twinization) of the dynamics and control of UAM vehicles at the core of UAM-ODT systems; (ii) the lack of back-end system engineering in the development of UAM vehicle DTs; and (iii) the lack of fault-tolerant mechanisms for the DT cloud back-end system to run uninterrupted operations 24/7. On the other hand, software aging and rejuvenation are becoming increasingly important in a variety of computing scenarios as the demand for reliable and available services increases. With the increasing use of containerized systems, there is also a need for an orchestrator to support easy management and reduce operational costs. In this paper, an operational digital twin (ODT) of a typical urban air mobility (UAM) infrastructure is developed on a private cloud system based on Kubernetes using a proposed cloud-in-the-loop simulation approach. To ensure the ODT can provide uninterrupted operational control and services in UAM around the clock, we propose a methodology for investigating software aging in Kubernetes-based containerized clouds. We evaluate the behavior of Kubernetes software using the Nginx and K3S tools while they manage pods in an accelerated lifetime experiment. We continuously execute operations for creating and terminating pods, allowing us to observe the utilization of computing resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and I/O), the performance of the Nginx and K3S environments, and the response time of an application hosted in those environments. In some conditions and for specific metrics, such as virtual memory usage, we observed the effects of software aging, including a memory leak that is not fully cleared when the cluster is stopped. These issues could lead to system performance degradation and eventually compromise the reliability and availability of the system when it crashes due to memory space exhaustion or full utilization of swap space on the hard disk. This study helps with the deployment and maintenance of virtualized environments from the standpoint of system dependability in digital twin computing infrastructures where a large number of services are running under strict continuity requirements. © 2023 by the authors.","cloud-in-the-loop simulation; K3S; Kubernetes; Nginx; operational digital twin; software aging; software rejuvenation; urban air mobility"

Challenges in energy storage density and geometry restriction both emphasize the propeller efficiency for endurance and takeoff weight, whereas the contra-rotating propellers (CRP) advantage is balancing high thrust and efficiency over a single propeller. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to present a novel rapid CRP blade shape optimization framework and (ii) to study the impact of the dual propellers revolution speed allocations on the overall CRP power efficiency. The core of the framework is the blade element momentum theory (BEMT)-based blade shape optimization considering the wake effect of the upper propeller by the rotational CFD (computational fluid dynamics) actuator-disc simulation method. The results show that for the same thrust, the optimized CRP at the equal revolution speed is superior to the original (upper-lower-identical) one by 5.9% in thrust-to-power ratio. The overall efficiency can be additionally lifted by 5.3% when the dual propellers share similar torques. By excluding the integral propeller CFD simulation and empirical parameters estimation, the framework enables the swift obtaining of an optimized CRP scheme while maintaining robustness as well. © 2023 by the authors.","blade element momentum theory; blade shape optimization; CFD actuator disc; contra-rotating propellers; eVTOL; hovering efficiency"

Firstly, the dynamic model of the contact process between the UAM and the target is derived. Then, a non-singular global fast terminal sliding mode controller (NGFTSMC) is proposed to guarantee that the contact process is completed within a finite time. Moreover, to compensate for system uncertainties and external disturbances, the equivalent part of the controller is estimated by an adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Finally, the Lyapunov theory is applied to validate the global stability of the closed-loop system and derive the adaptive law for the neural network weight matrix online updating.

Video streaming services can provide constant data transactions in a huge amount, especially in its operational digital twin (ODT). As a result, the ability to provide a satisfactory user experience through video streaming platforms is critical and complex. This requires continuously operating services while handling numerous user requests for near real-time video streaming. At the same time, high-quality video with high resolution and minimal interruptions is often expected. Therefore, the availability and performance (i.e., performability) of the Back-End video streaming infrastructure are crucial parameters for these platforms. However, evaluating novel video-on-demand architectures in real-world scenarios can be costly due to the numerous parameters involved. Analytical models, such as stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), can serve as an alternative in this complex scenario as they can be used to analyze systems during the design process. In this study, we developed a set of SPN models to assess the performance of a video-on-demand system. These models were designed to illustrate and to evaluate a video-on-demand architecture while considering performance. We had a base SPN model as well as three enhanced variants available. The extended models were generated using the Design of Experiments (DoE) technique and sensitivity analysis results. The DoE identified the factors with the greatest impacts on performance, and the most significant factor interactions. Redundancy strategies were applied to the extended models to increase the availability of the most important components. This redundancy increased the availability of “9 s” from three to five.

The major electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) concepts being studied and developed currently are 3-types, “Vectored Thrust”, “Lift + Cruise”, and “Wingless”. This paper focuses on the Wingless eVTOL because it has effective performances for short-range flight operation that will take the main role of Japanese UAM. Conventionally, a heavy rotor aircraft such as helicopter uses variable pitch to control thrust quickly, and heavy Wingless eVTOLs are suggested to have variable pitch as well. However, owing to the development of strong electric motors, the Wingless eVTOL like CityAirbus and VoloCity is controllable by variable speed method as well as UAV. The advantage of variable speed is significant regarding simplicity and maintenance cost. We analyzed the Wingless eVTOL detailed dynamics with rotor aerodynamics (blade element theory and momentum theory) and simple electric motor model. We took care of an additional counter torque by rotor inertia. UAV has the same effect, but it is so relatively small to air drag torque that it can be ignored. For the Wingless eVTOL, the angular acceleration of rotor brings large effect to control yaw. In order to overcome rotor inertia, we used many small propellers and the existing latest motor. This paper includes eVTOL dynamics that has unique behaviors and characteristics including both conventional helicopter and UAV. Moreover, our control architecture includes the command filtering, the reference model, the linear feedback and feedforward controller, the incremental dynamics inversion, and the mixer of 8 coaxial rotor with taking the rotor inertia.

Usually, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used widely for reinforcement learning of quadrotors. However, PPO algorithms for quadrotors tend to fail to guarantee the stability of the guidance law in the environment as the search space increases. In this work, we show the improvements of stability in a multi-agent quadrotor-type UAM environment by applying the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. The simulations were performed in Unity. Our results achieved three times better reward in the Urban Air Mobility environment than when trained with the PPO algorithm and our approach also shows faster training time than the PPO algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep reinforcement learning; Multi-agent system; Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO); Soft Actor-Critic (SAC); Traffic network; Urban Air Mobility (UAM)"

Digital twin technology (DT) introduces a coupled virtual-physical asset system that evolves over time in their digital and physical state-spaces associated with the real-time exchange of observed data and control inputs for high-fidelity operational services in UAM, such as traffic management, or vehicle maintenance. On the other hand, edge computing has been envisioned as a dominant computing paradigm in future UAM infrastructures to enable infinitesimal-latency processing of massive and heterogeneous data acquired from ubiquitous devices and vehicles. Furthermore, federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed to resolve the performance and security problems of traditional AI techniques featured by centralized data collection and training to offer a decentralized and cooperative data training pattern among a huge number of devices/vehicles (aka., agents) in multi agent DT systems for UAM. Lastly, the blockchain has emerged as a ledger technology in which data and processes are divided into tiny data blocks and concatenated into a series to reinforce the security and scalability of decentralized computing patterns. Realizing the advances and integration of the emerging technologies mentioned above is of paramount importance for the development of DT systems in UAM. Previous studies have not completely considered the integration and harmony of these existing technologies for the development of UAM DT systems. There has also been a significant lack in comprehension and integration of emerging technologies for the development of UAM-DT systems. In that context, this study proposes a comprehensive integrated UAM-DT platform and solution of FL with the blockchain in edge computing for the development of UAM-DT systems, called BlockFE-DT. First, we introduce the adoption of a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical foundation of coupled digital-physical twin systems for UAM, particularly for unmanned aircrafts. Afterwards, we review the fundamental concepts of FL, blockchain, and edge computing technologies to explore and propose an integration framework of FL with the blockchain in edge computing in the context of UAM-DT systems. Key issues in the integration are assimilated including explainable AI, dependability, and security. This work provides ground-breaking concepts and architectures for a blockchain empowered FL framework with edge computing in future UAM-DT systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Digital twin; Edge computing; Federated learning; Urban Air Mobility"

To address this issue, the flight characteristics of the UAM should be evaluated under an actual urban wind environment. In this study, a method of generating realistic urban wind environments is suggested. The weather research and forecasting (WRF)–large eddy simulation (LES) coupled model with the iterative nesting algorithm was adopted to generate a wind environment with sufficient resolution for UAM.

Based on the flight dynamic equations, the 6-DOF mathematical model of quad-rotor UAS is established. A flight control law based on nonlinear dynamic inversion method is designed for the quadrotor to follow the expected path. Then, the airspace below 120 m is divided into several layers. UAM aircrafts with a similar flight heading fly in a same layer and the vertical separation of high risk UAM aircrafts can be maintained.

Firstly, image features with nice decoupling characteristics are designed and the relationship between the camera motion and the image features is derived. Then, a two-stage strategy is proposed to achieve force tracking of the UAM on a planar object in an arbitrary pose. The first stage drives the end-effector perpendicular to the object's planer surface by pure visual servoing. To achieve force tracking under the visual guidance, an adaptive visual impedance control method which adjusts the target stiffness according to the force tracking error and the visual feature error is proposed in the second stage. The closed-loop system is proved asymptotically stable by means of Lyapunov analysis. Further, the stability in free flight phase of the stage two is also analyzed and ensured. Finally, experiments were carried out including a whiteboard cleaning task in different poses. The experimental results illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Note to Practitioners - This work is motivated by the contact force tracking problem of an unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM) without the position measurement. In recent years, impedance control is widely used in force tracking problems. However, position measurement is needed both for the robot and the object in most studies. To generate desired force under visual guidance, image-based visual servoing is combined with a novel impedance controller with variable stiffness. The idea is intuitive. For a human in contact with a wall, the contact force is controlled by adjusting his arm stiffness, which means the stiffness is adapted to the difference between the desired and actual contact force. Furthermore, the stiffness is also adapted to the visual tracking error, removing the assumption that no tracking error is in the inner loop of the impedance controller in the previous works. The proposed strategy is a promising solution for real applications and is validated by a board cleaning experiment in this paper. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Aerial manipulation; force tracking; impedance control; visual servoing"

The lining at the contact position is prone to shear and torsion damage. During tunnel operation, shear failure of the lining under earthquake action has attracted widespread attention from researchers. However, there is a lack of clear understanding of the deformation model when a subsea tunnel crosses a fault zone under the condition of high water pressure. In this study, a 3 D-FEM model and theoretical solutions are employed to analyze the characteristics of the lining deformation and evaluate the effectiveness of different pre-reinforcement measures. The models can effectively simulate the construction process of the earth pressure balance shield (EPBS), such as the face pressure, jack force, EPBS gravity, grouting and hardening of the tail void, and they can also accurately simulate different pre-reinforcement measures, such as the umbrella arch method. The results show that the position of damage to the lining is related to the inclination angle of the fault, and the slippage of the fault causes local shear and torsion deformation of the lining.

A major challenge for UAM is to ensure reliable two-way wireless communications between aerial vehicles and their associated ground air traffic control centers for safe operations. The concept of cellular-based UAM (cUAM) provides a promising solution for reliable air-ground communications in urban air transportation, where each aerial vehicle is integrated into an existing cellular network as a new aerial user, sharing the cellular spectrum with existing terrestrial users. Generally, the additional aeronautical use of cellular spectrum can introduce harmful interference to current terrestrial communications, which only amplifies the severity of spectrum scarcity issues. Therefore, a new spectrum management solution is necessary for cUAM applications. In this article, we first introduce the communication requirements and spectrum management challenges in cUAM. Then we propose to apply deep reinforcement learning technology to perform dynamic spectrum management in cUAM. Next, a cUAM use case is investigated where a deep-reinforcement-learning-based dynamic spectrum sharing solution is proposed to minimize the total UAM mission completion time. Numerical results show that the proposed solution can reduce the mission completion time and improve the spectrum utilization efficiency.

Meanwhile, the widely deployed Internet of drones (IoD) in smart cities has also brought up new concerns regarding performance, security, and privacy. The centralized framework adopted by conventional UAM networks is not adequate to handle high mobility and dynamicity. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure device authentication, data integrity, and privacy preservation in UAM networks. Thanks to its characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and unalterability, blockchain is recognized as a promising technology to enhance security and privacy for UAM networks. In this paper, we introduce LightMAN, a lightweight microchained fabric for data assurance and resilience-oriented UAM networks. LightMAN is tailored for small-scale permissioned UAV networks, in which a microchain acts as a lightweight distributed ledger for security guarantees. Thus, participants are enabled to authenticate drones and verify the genuineness of data that are sent to/from drones without relying on a third-party agency. In addition, a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage strategy is adopted that not only improves performance (e.g., latency and throughput) but also ensures privacy preservation for sensitive information in UAM networks. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and tested on a micro-air–vehicle link (MAVLink) simulator.

Regulation and definition of aerial networks, but also the characterization of ground facilities (vertiports) to allow passengers and freight to access the services are among the most relevant issues to be discussed. To identify UAM transportation networks, suitably connected with ground transportation services, digital twin models could be adopted to support the modelling and simulation of existing—and expected—scenarios with constantly updated data for identifying solutions addressing the design and management of transport systems.

In order to verify whether a communication network for a new non-terrestrial user service such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) satisfies the required performance, it is necessary to perform a simulation reflecting the characteristics of the corresponding terrain environments as accurately as possible. For this simulation, A2G channel models corresponding to various terrain environments and a method of automatically classifying the terrain type of the simulation area must be provided. Many A2G channel models based on actual measurement results exist, but the practical automatic topography classification method still needs to be developed. This paper proposes the first practical automatic topography classification method using a two-step neural network-based classifier utilizing various geographic feature data as input. Since there is no open topography dataset to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we built a new dataset for five topography classes that reflect the characteristics of Korea’s topography, which is also a contribution of our study. The simulation results using the new data set show that the proposed ML-based method could increase the selection accuracy compared to the technique for direct classification by humans or the existing cross-correlation-based classification method. Since the proposed method utilizes the DSM data, open to the public, it can easily reflect the different terrain characteristics of each country.

Assignment of unacceptable HLA mismatches (UAMs) prevents transplantation of incompatible grafts but potentially prolongs waiting time. Whether this is true in the Eurotransplant Kidney Allocation System (ETKAS) and the Eurotransplant Senior Program in Germany is highly debated and relevant for UAM policies. Methods. Donor pool restriction due to UAM was expressed as percent virtual panel-reactive antibodies (vPRAs). Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox regression models were used to analyze the impact of vPRA levels on waiting time and transplant probability during a period of 2 y in all patients eligible for a kidney graft unter standard circumstances in Germany on February 1, 2019 (n = 6533). Utility of the mismatch probability score to compensate for sensitization in ETKAS was also investigated. Results. In ETKAS, donor pool restriction resulted in significant prolongation of waiting time and reduction in transplant probability only in patients with vPRA levels above 85%. This was most evident in patients with vPRA levels above 95%, whereas patients in the acceptable mismatch program had significantly shorter waiting times and higher chances for transplantation than nonsensitized patients. In the Eurotransplant Senior Program, vPRA levels above 50% resulted in significantly longer waiting times and markedly reduced the chance for transplantation. Compensation for sensitization by the mismatch probability score was insufficient. Conclusions. Donor pool restriction had no significant impact on waiting time in most sensitized patients. However, despite the existence of the acceptable mismatch program, the majority of highly sensitized patients is currently disadvantaged and would benefit from better compensation mechanisms. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Here, we propose a new biochronological frame for conodonts that is based on the Unitary Associations Method (UAM). In this new time frame, the SSB can thus be placed between the climax of the extinction and the onset of the re-diversification. Based on the study of new and rich conodont collections obtained from five sections (of which four are newly described here) in the Nanpanjiang Basin, South China, we have performed a thorough taxonomical revision and described one new genus and 21 new species. Additionally, we have critically reassessed the published conodont data from 16 other sections from South China, and we have used this new, standardized dataset to construct the most accurate, highly resolved, and laterally reproducible biozonation of the Smithian to early Spathian interval for South China. The resulting 11 Unitary Association Zones (UAZ) are intercalibrated with lithological and chemostratigraphical (δ13Ccarb) markers, as well as with ammonoid zones, thus providing a firm basis for an evolutionary meaningful and laterally consistent definition of the SSB. Our UAZ8, which is characterized by the occurrence of Icriospathodus ex gr. crassatus, Triassospathodus symmetricus and Novispathodus brevissimus, is marked by a new evolutionary radiation of both conodonts and ammonoids and is within a positive peak in the carbon isotope record. Consequently, we propose to place the SSB within the separation interval intercalated between UAZ7 and UAZ8 thus leaving some flexibility for future refinement and updating. © 2022, The Author(s).","Conodonts; Smithian–Spathian boundary; South China; Unitary associations"

Electric machines and drives have been identified as limiting propulsion subsystems with failure rates in the range of 10-5 - 10-6 failures/h. Fault-tolerant (FT) machine drives offer a promising approach to improve reliability using existing technology. An FT integrated modular motor drive (IMMD) design is proposed for a quadrotor UAM application, and its estimated reliability is studied using Markov chain analysis. Quantitative examples show that raising the repair rate for the motor drive modules significantly reduces the IMMD's catastrophic failure rate. However, the lower bound on its failure rate with high repair rates is determined by its single-point failure (SPF) rate (e.g., motor bearings), highlighting the importance of aggressively suppressing as many of the IMMD's SPFs as possible. Markov chain analysis shows that SPF suppression can result in major reductions in the IMMD catastrophic failure rate by factors exceeding $10^{3}$ as the SPF rate is driven toward its ideal limit value of zero. © 2015 IEEE.","Electric propulsion; fault tolerance; Markov chains; modular motor drives; reliability"

First, taking into account the dynamic characteristics of the coupled UAM, the dynamic model of the coupled system is derived. Then, based on the perspective projection model, the appropriate image features are defined on the virtual image plane to obtain decoupled image feature dynamics. Combining image features dynamics and UAM dynamics, the position and attitude controller of the UAM flying platform with the center of gravity compensation is derived. Furthermore, the image feature motion is further applied to the positioning control of the end-effector of the onboard manipulator. In addition, the UAM motion distribution strategy is designed to coordinate the movement between the UAM flying platform and the onboard manipulator. The simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed visual servo control based on image dynamics. As a result, the trajectories of the feature points are smooth in the real image plane, which means the UAM movement is stable. Finally, the experimental results in an outdoor environment verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed visual servo control method for autonomous operations. The proposed control method manages the UAM from an unknown initial position to the desired position, which can be applied to various types of aerial operations missions such as object transmission. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Image dynamics; unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM); virtual camera; visual servo"

Italy hosts two brown bear populations, Ursus arctos marsicanus (Uam), endemic to the Apennines of central Italy, and Ursus arctos arctos (Uaa), in the Italian Alps. Both populations are endangered and occasionally involved in human-wildlife conflict; thus, detailed management plans have been in place for several decades, including genetic monitoring. Here, we propose a simple cost-effective microsatellite-based protocol for the management of populations with low genetic variation. We sampled 22 Uam and 22 Uaa individuals and analyzed a total of 32 microsatellite loci in order to evaluate their applicability in individual identification. Based on genetic variability estimates, we compared data from four different STR marker sets, to evaluate the optimal settings in long-term monitoring projects. Allelic richness and gene diversity were the highest for the Uaa population, whereas depleted genetic variability was noted for the Uam population, which should be regarded as a conservation priority. Our results identified the most effective STR sets for the estimation of genetic diversity and individual discrimination in Uam (9 loci, PIC 0.45; PID 2.0 × 10-5), and Uaa (12 loci, PIC 0.64; PID 6.9 × 10-11) populations, which can easily be utilized by smaller laboratories to support local governments in regular population monitoring. The method we proposed to select the most variable markers could be adopted for the genetic characterization of other small and isolated populations.","fragment analysis; genetic diversity; individual identification; invasive and non-invasive genetic profiles; marker selection; Ursus arctos arctos; Ursus arctos marsicanus"

This paper optimizes the number, locations, and capacities of vertiports in UAM systems while capturing interdependencies between strategic vertiport deployment, tactical operations, and passenger demand. Academic/practical relevance: The model includes a “tractable part” (based on mixed-integer second-order conic optimization) and also a nonconvex demand function. Methodology: We develop an exact algorithm that approximates nonconvex functions with piecewise constant segments, iterating between a conservative model (which yields a feasible solution) and a relaxed model (which yields a solution guarantee). We propose an adaptive discretization scheme that converges to a global optimum—because of the relaxed model. Results: Our algorithm converges to a 1% optimality gap, dominating static discretization benchmarks in terms of solution quality, runtimes, and solution guarantee. Managerial implications: We find that the most attractive structure for UAM is one that uses a few high-capacity vertiports, consolidating operations primarily to serve long-distance trips. Moreover, UAM profitability is highly sensitive to network planning optimization and to customer expectations, perhaps even more so than to vehicle specifications. Therefore, the success of UAM operations requires not only mature eVTOL technologies but also tailored analytics-based capabilities to optimize strategic planning and market-based efforts to drive customer demand. © 2022 INFORMS.","adaptive discretization; network planning; urban aerial mobility"

Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) and their variants have previously been studied and applied in real-world situations, but these problems require additional depot locations, and not all the vehicles can travel to all the locations. In UAM operations, additional depot locations may not be required, and all vehicles can travel to all locations, meaning that existing routing problems are not suitable for application to the management of UAMs. Therefore, we propose a new formulation for UAM vertiport-to-vertiport operation by introducing new constraints. In addition, we integrate dynamic scheduling with the flight mission by controlling cruise speed and waiting in each UAM at each vertiport location to generate an arrival and departure schedule for different vertiports that can avoid collisions and increase the number of vehicles. A computational experiment is conducted using an MILP model, and the results show that although our formulation satisfies the problem definition, the computation time increases exponentially with an increase in the problem size. A case study is conducted in the Seoul area involving five vertiports, with 10- and 15-vehicle scenarios studied. This case study shows that the cruise speed variable is active only for the lower and upper bounds under dynamic scheduling, whereas the waiting time variable can be controlled between user-defined limits that can be applied to the management of vertiport-to-vertiport UAM operations. © 2022 by the authors.","dynamic scheduling; multivehicle point-to-point network; problem formulation; UAM operation"

To achieve active anti-disturbance and high tracking accuracy in a UAM system, we incorporate an RBF neural network into the controller to estimate lumped disturbances, including internal coupling and external disturbances. The controller and neural network are derived according to Lyapunov theory to ensure the system’s stability. In addition, we propose a set of illustrative metrics to evaluate the performance of the designed controller and compare it with other controllers by simulations.

In this paper, we present the green synthesis of AgNPs using two Pseudomonas alloputida B003 UAM culture broths, sampled from their exponential and stationary growth phases. AgNPs were physicochemically characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), showing differential characteristics depending on the synthesis method used.

We also monitored nanoparticles’ synergic behavior through the growth inhibition of E. coli and S. aureus by three classical antibiotics: ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin. The results indicate that very good AgNP activity was obtained with particularly low MICs for the three tested strains of P. aeruginosa. A good synergistic effect on streptomycin activity was observed for all the nanoparticles. For ampicillin, a synergic effect was detected only against S. aureus.

A series of analytical processes for vertiport design, demand prediction, and performance analysis is presented. To design the vertiport layout, we propose a novel algorithm that evaluates the surrounding obstacles by considering current regulations. The potential demand for air taxi services by urban air mobility (UAM) as multimodal transportation is predicted by a discrete choice model that estimates the probability of choosing an air taxi service given the time saving of UAM. Then, the sensitivity of demand was analyzed for the catchment area, travel cost, and the number of passengers on board. The sensitivity analysis showed that the demand for UAM was sensitive to all factors considered. Vertiport performance is evaluated by comparing the expected number of operations derived from the UAM demand to the vertiport capacity. The proposed methodology was applied to a vertiport in the Seoul metropolitan area for the initial UAM operations. The results show that having one less gate significantly increases the waiting time of the UAM when the utilization factor of the waiting queue is high. However, the average waiting time is less than 20 min (the maximum hover time of eVTOL vehicles) if the vertiport has a sufficient number of gates, depending on the traffic volume of UAM. Therefore, it is essential to determine the number of gates considering the expected traffic volume to ensure safe UAM operations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.","On-demand service; Urban air mobility; Vertiport capacity; Vertiport design; Vertiport performance"

This feasibility study aimed to (1) evaluate the implementation rate of pharmacists' recommendations intended to de-escalate UAMs, (2) quantify the change in overall anticholinergic dosing exposure from these recommendations, and (3) investigate factors that predict recommendation implementation. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational, before-and-after study. Pharmacists (n = 18) devised strategies to de-escalate UAMs in 187 participants (mean age 72.4 ± 9.4; 77.0% female; mean number of medications 12.9 ± 4.6) of 35 Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE prescribers (non-physicians and physicians) determined whether to implement recommendations. Implementation was defined as a change in the prescription records consistent with the pharmacist's recommendation at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 9-months post-recommendation. Anticholinergic dosing exposure was measured at each time point using standardized daily doses (SDD). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors that predicted recommendation implementation. Results: Across 9 months, recommendations were implemented in 118 out of 187 participants, yielding a 63.1% implementation rate. Of these, 77.1% (n = 91/118) implemented by month 2. Implementers' mean overall anticholinergic SDD decreased 65.4% from baseline (baseline: 2.6 [95% CI: 2.2, 3.0] to month 9: 0.9 [95% CI: 0.6,1.2], p < 0.001) whereas non-implementers demonstrated no significant change (p = 0.52). Taking <10 baseline medications (OR 2.75; 95% CI: 1.09, 7.61); baseline UAM SDD ≥2 (OR 2.20; 95% CI: 1.11, 4.44); uncomplicated recommendations (OR 3.38; 95% CI: 1.67–7.03); and baseline calcium channel blocker use (OR 2.19; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.52) predicted implementation. Conclusion: Our high implementation rate indicates that pharmacists' recommendations to de-escalate UAMs as a way to reduce overall anticholinergic exposure is feasible in medically complex, community-dwelling older adults. Future research should investigate whether these recommendations benefit cognitive (e.g., delirium, dementia) and/or physical functioning (e.g., falls). © 2022 Tabula Rasa HealthCare.

Although cellular networks are one of the prominent candidates to provide connectivity for such operations, their ground-centric nature limits their capabilities in achieving seamless and reliable aerial connectivity. In this paper, we study the feasibility of supporting RP operations with low latency and high-quality video delivery over commercial cellular networks. By setting up an adaptive bitrate video transmission pipeline with the Google Congestion Control (GCC) and Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia (SCReAM) Congestion Control (CC) algorithms, we analyze the video delivery performance for the RP application requirements and compare the performance of GCC and SCReAM against constant bitrate video delivery. Our results show that low-latency video delivery with < 300 ms playback latency between full-HD and 4K resolution can be maintained up to about 95% of the time in the air. While static bitrate video delivery outperforms adaptive streaming in urban location with abundant link capacity, the latter becomes advantageous in rural locations, where the link capacity is affected by fluctuations. Although the study’s findings highlight the capabilities of cellular networks in delivering low-latency video for a safety-critical aerial service, we also discuss the potential improvements and future research challenges for enabling safe operations and meeting the service requirements using cellular networks.

For consumers, they can realize their attitudes to products through the various lexical attitudinal resources indicating emotion and judgment, and for sellers they act as a form of customer feedback which can enhance the relationship between buyers and sellers. In that sense they improve the operation of the market price mechanism. The purpose of this study is to investigate the Interpersonal meanings realized through the attitude resources drawn upon by English and Chinese online consumers. Based on the Appraisal System, especially the Attitude System in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), this study conducts a contrastive analysis of the attitudinal resources employed by consumers in Amazon UK and Amazon China. These features are analyzed by using the UAM CorpusTool to annotate the relevant resources, with similarities and differences in the general distribution of attitudinal resources identified, and any potential underlying reasons explained. The results of this study suggest that different features and distribution of attitudinal resources are employed in English and Chinese online consumer reviews, and that more attitudinal units are involved in English online consumer reviews than in the Chinese versions. Consumers from the United Kingdom also seem to use more affect resources than Chinese consumers in their online reviews, while Chinese consumers employ slightly more judgment resources and more appreciation resources.

This paper presents a new air-cooling system for an electrical machine in an electric ducted fan propulsion system. The novel cooling system consists of a cooling guide vane with a heat pipe (CGVHP), which is located downstream of the ducted fan rotating blade. The heated end of the heat pipe is inserted into the stator end windings and the cold end is inserted into the cooling guide vane. The heat generated in the windings is transmitted to the cooling guide vane by the heat pipe and dissipated by the forced convection using low-temperature air passing through the ducted fan. The cooling performance of the cooling guide vane with the heat pipe was numerically simulated, considering several critical design factors.

We propose a simulation framework that facilitates analyzing the potential demand of UAM. We define five scenarios (ranging from representations of a niche application to a mass transport option) by varying the fleet size, available technologies, infrastructure placement, and pricing strategies. These scenarios are fed into an extended version of the agent-based transport simulation platform MATSim chained with the microscopic transportation orchestrator. The simulation results show that the system configuration has a big impact on UAM demand. The infrastructure capacity and fleet size were identified as the main bottlenecks. We see high levels of demand during peak hours and for trips up to 20 km; however, none of the scenarios result in a sufficiently high modal share of UAM that substantially reduces traffic volumes of ground-based modes, and hence have no significant impact on congestion. Yet, the different trip purposes generate significantly different demands. UAM for airport access could be an especially relevant modal choice in the premium airport-passenger segment. When aiming for an effective and sustainable UAM service, our recommendations are as follows: first, use it to support and improve, rather than cannibalize, existing public transport options; and second, minimize negative impacts on the environment and society to maximize public acceptance. © 2022 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",

The problem is formulated as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process with continuous action space and is solved by a customized decentralized online algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To guarantee the safety of real-time autonomous flight operations in uncertain environments, the formulation of loss of chance constrained separation is introduced and integrated with the proposed MCTS algorithm. In addition, Gaussian process regression along with Bayesian optimization is employed to discretize the continuous action space, which helps shorten the flight time.

The mechanical properties, in vitro simulation of bile flow and cytocompatibility of BPU-UAM ABD were evaluated in vitro, and surgical implantation in the biliary defect site in minipigs was implemented to reveal the in vivo degradation of BPU-UAM and regeneration of the new bile duct. The results indicated that BPU-UAM ABD with a mechanical strength of 11.9 MPa has excellent cytocompatibility to support 3T3 fibroblast survival and proliferation in extraction medium and on the scaffolds. The in vivo implantation of BPU-UAM ABD revealed the change of collagen content throughout the new bile duct regeneration.

This paper presents an air traffic assignment framework for 3D air transport networks in urban airspace to enable UAM operations at future demand levels. The individual vehicle dynamics are aggregated to describe the overall flow feature in this macroscopic model. Firstly, UAM operations are modeled as flows and structured in a three-dimensional two-way air transport network. Then, a complexity optimal air traffic assignment in urban airspace is formulated as an optimization problem. Based upon the Linear Dynamical System (LDS), a novel complexity metric is defined as objective function, which takes into account dynamic flow structure, congestion, and operational efficiency. A two-phase approach combining Simulated Annealing (SA) and Dafermos’ Algorithm (DA) is introduced to efficiently solve this problem. To validate the proposed model, a case study of an air transport network in Singapore's urban airspace with two different demands is conducted. Comparative studies are carried out between the proposed algorithm and other widely used traffic assignment algorithms. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of assigning flows in an efficient and effective manner, reducing the complexity of the air transport network significantly. The results also show that optimizing the flow pattern reduces total complexity by 90.44%±0.53% and 92.12%±0.35% with 95% confidence interval, respectively in two scenarios.

The method was tested in different scenarios, offering robust results. Execution times were of the order of 50 milliseconds, allowing the implementation in real time on modern onboard computers. © 2022 by the authors.","detect and avoid; LiDAR; second order cone program; UAM corridor"

Visual sensors have the potential of providing accurate measurements with reduced budgets, although integrity issues, as well as performance degradation in low visibility and highly dynamic environments, may pose challenges. In this context, this paper focuses on autonomous navigation during vertical approach and landing procedures and provides three main contributions. First, visual sensing requirements relevant to Urban Air Mobility scenarios are defined considering realistic landing trajectories, landing pad dimensions, and wind effects. Second, a multi-sensor-based navigation architecture based on an Extended Kalman Filter is presented which integrates visual estimates with inertial and GNSS measurements and includes different operating modes and ad hoc integrity checks. The presented processing pipeline is built to provide the required navigation performance in different conditions including day/night flight, atmospheric disturbances, low visibility, and can support the autonomous initialization of a missed approach procedure. Third, performance assessment of the proposed architecture is conducted within a highly realistic simulation environment which reproduces real world scenarios and includes variable weather and illumination conditions. Results show that the proposed architecture is robust with respect to dynamic and environmental challenges, providing cm-level positioning uncertainty in the final landing phase. Furthermore, autonomous initialization of a Missed Approach Procedure is demonstrated in case of loss of visual contact with the landing pad and consequent increase of the self-estimated navigation uncertainty. © 2022 by the authors.","autonomous approach and landing; multi-sensor-based navigation; Urban Air Mobility; Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft; visual landing pad; visual sensing requirements"

This study explores the economic feasibility of the UAM airport shuttle service from two perspectives. First, this study estimates the fare of UAM services to attract customers. The UAM service should maintain a competitive price to convert existing transportation users into UAM users. This study used Incheon Airport (ICN) ground transportation data to estimate a competitive fare based on the multinomial logit model. The pricing range at which UAM services can obtain users from Seoul Station to ICN is estimated to be 96 to 108 USD, assuming the new service reduces traveling time by 30–40 min compared to taxi service. The comparison with professional institutions indicates that the 96–108 USD price range is feasible. However, according to a simulation based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, other approaches to increase economic feasibility are required. Second, this study reviewed operational policies to improve the economic feasibility of UAM shuttle services from two perspectives. The first is a service perspective that introduces new services or enhances the current service level. The internalization of CNS (communications, navigation, and surveillance) and UTM (unmanned traffic management) services can be a new business area, including premium routing. The second is introducing a dynamic pricing policy. Segmented pricing, time-based pricing, and changing market conditions strategies can practically strengthen the economic feasibility. Operating an airport Vertiport providing a dedicated path for UAM passengers can allow UAM operators to charge more on a premium passenger segment by shortening airport procedure time. Because it can avoid the uncertainty of road congestion, there is plenty of incentive to set higher fares during peak times with severe congestion. In addition, by creating a market environment in which multiple operators participate, the operators can share the burden of infrastructure construction and operation, which account for more than 80% of the total operating costs, increasing the economic feasibility of services. © 2022","Airport shuttle; Airport vertiport; Dynamic pricing policy; Economic feasibility; Multinomial logit model; Urban air mobility"

This tunnel passes under Modares freeway, a major artery in Tehran and is part of the Arash project. The construction of a tunnel with a large, approximately square cross-section on a disturbed soil stratum and the existence of adjacent embedded canals (qanat) have made the Modares tunnel one of the most challenging parts of this project. This uncommon square shape was chosen due to limitations caused by adjacent facilities. All combinations of three supporting systems (forepoling UAM, soil nailing and micropiling) were investigated using the numerical method. The influence of these methods on surface settlement and the adequacy of the initial tunnel lining are discussed. In short, forepoling was the most effective with a 24% decrease in settlement compared to the initial model. Combining the forepoling and nailing systems decreased the settlement by 37.5% and was the most effective synchronic system.

This study aims to estimate the parameters of the mode choice model incorporating the cleaner transportation mode and evaluate the environmental impact by calculating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ground traffic. A stated preference survey is employed to estimate the parameters for each travel mode, including the emerging travel mode. The awareness and experience of the air travel modes remove the hesitation concerning travel mode choice having positive values, but concerns about taking new types of air mobility reduce the probability of choosing urban air mobility. The macroscopic travel demand forecasting program simulates the travel demand of urban air mobility to calculate the reduction of CO2 emissions between before and after the introduction. While about 30 thousand of urban air mobility travel demand are generated after the introduction of urban air mobility in the urban area, it reduces about 90 thousand tons of CO2 emissions from the ground traffic. The introduction of urban air mobility causes modal shifts from ground traffic, reducing climate change and global warming.

With this unsupervised adaptive myocontrol (UAM) system, optimal synergies for control are continuously co-adapted with changes in user motor control, or as a function of perturbed conditions via online non-negative matrix factorization guided by physiologically informed sparseness constraints in lieu of explicit data labelling. Methods: UAM was tested in a set of virtual target reaching tasks completed by able-bodied and amputee subjects. Tests were conducted under normative and electrode perturbed conditions to gauge control robustness with comparisons to non-adaptive and supervised adaptive myocontrol schemes. Furthermore, UAM was used to interface an amputee with a multi-functional powered hand prosthesis during standardized Clothespin Relocation Tests, also conducted in normative and perturbed conditions. Results: In virtual tests, UAM effectively mitigated performance degradation caused by electrode displacement, affording greater resilience over an existing supervised adaptive system for amputee subjects. Induced electrode shifts also had negligible effect on the real world control performance of UAM with consistent completion times (23.91±1.33 s) achieved across Clothespin Relocation Tests in the normative and electrode perturbed conditions. Conclusion: UAM affords comparable robustness improvements to existing supervised adaptive myocontrol interfaces whilst providing additional practical advantages for clinical deployment.

Therefore, this paper selects, categorizes and summarizes existing literature in a systematic fashion and strives to support the harmonization process of contributions made by industry, research and regulatory authorities. Through a document term matrix approach, we identified 49 Scopus-listed scientific publications (2016–2021) addressing the topic of UAM ground infrastructure with respect to airspace operation followed by design, location and network, throughput and capacity, ground operations, cost, safety, regulation, weather and lastly noise and security. Last listed topics from cost onwards appear to be substantially under-represented, but will be influencing current developments and challenges.

UAM vehicles can navigate themselves using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) tightly coupled systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to IMU failures aside from GNSS faults, given that UAM vehicles will use low-cost IMUs. IMU faults can severely degrade navigation integrity, thereby threatening UAM operational safety and increasing the difficulty of urban air traffic management. This issue can be mitigated by employing redundant IMUs. Civil aircraft use consistency checks among multiple high-performance Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) to enhance navigation integrity. But this approach is not suitable for low-cost IMUs because of fast error accumulation. In response, this work proposes a new approach to enhance navigation integrity for UAM by integrating multiple IMUs with GNSS. In this approach, multiple IMUs and GNSS are tightly coupled by a centralized Kalman filter, and the corresponding integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to (a) detect the faults in GNSS and/or IMUs and (b) evaluate the probabilistic upper bounds on navigation errors, namely protection levels. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method and to present sensitivity analyses, and the results suggest the effectiveness of the new approach. This method is beneficial to improving UAM operational safety and can potentially be applied to civil aircraft in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Fault detection; Integrity; Multiple inertial measurement units; Protection level; Urban Air Mobility"

We first build an unabridged channel attention (UCA) mechanism on feature maps within each block for feature recalibration. We further design a top-down adjacent modulation (TAM) for decoder blocks. By deploying TAM, high-level semantic information and visual contexts can be gradually transferred into lower-level layers without loss. The joint implementation of UCA and TAM ensures that the encoder has an enhanced feature representation ability, and the low-level features of the decoders contain abundant semantic contexts.

However, ground transportation in big urban centers has been facing challenges for many years (e.g., resilience and congestion) and new paradigms have been proposed, such as the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept. UAM aims to enhance the urban transportation system using manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing-eVTOL-vehicles). Although UAM offers many benefits (e.g., cost reduction and increase in transportation capacity), many challenges need to be faced to enable safe and efficient operations. Furthermore, trajectory planning is challenging in the National Airspace System (NAS) and UAM operations due to several factors. Finally, new initiatives concerning UAM trajectory planning can be accelerated with the support of an automatic what-if platform capable of evaluating trajectories feasibility and efficiency. This research aims to propose a simulation platform for enabling trajectory evaluation in UAM operations. This platform, named Trajectory-Based Urban Air Mobility Simulator (TUS), focuses on simulating trajectories in the urban aerial environment. TUS enables users to test new UAM algorithms (e.g., flow management strategies, real-time evaluation of maneuvers effectiveness, airspace configurations) and simulate both manned and unmanned vehicles. Furthermore, TUS operation relies on a set of inputs and evaluates the trajectories generated from efficiency and safety perspectives. This process is performed using a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) approach. The experiments performed showed that TUS can perform a realistic evaluation of UAM trajectories and can be effortlessly used to simulate hundreds of scenarios. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","efficiency; simulation; trajectory evaluation; unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Urban air mobility (UAM)"

A dual-mode flying automobile with an aerial electric vehicle (AEV), a ground electric vehicle (GEV), and a cabin is a future method of transportation that can be used in both the air and on the ground. To enable AEVs to land in a specific position, a landing site is necessary. The proposed AEV uses vertical take-off and landing, and a vertiport landing site is required. As vertical take-off and landing sites require a lot of space and are challenging to operate in multiple positions, we suggest a mobile vertiport that can fit into a small space. A mobile station is appropriate for dual-mode flying cars since it includes critical activities such as transporting AEVs from the ground and charging as well as a cabin-delivery system. The mobile station can generate a path to the AEV by calculating the relative position using the markers attached to the AEV and estimating the position of the landing AEV. The mobile station detects a marker for precise positioning correction, followed by exact position correction for cabin delivery, to travel to the accurate position of the AEV. To increase the success rate of cabin delivery, docking markers are identified and the angle position error between the mobile station and cabin is computed and corrected to rectify the position between the cabin and the mobile station for cabin delivery. In addition, the experimental results revealed a mechanically correctable error range that encompassed all experimental values. Consequently, this study showed that image processing may be used to create a mobile station for dual-mode flying automobiles. © 2022 by the authors.

Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission has been adapted in NOMA systems to improve the performance of a cell edge user. Conventional CoMP combines received signals from multiple sources using maximum ratio combining (MRC) in order to improve the user's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While MRC provides the highest diversity gain of any diversity combining technology, it requires latency for co-phasing and combining the received signals. Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has emerged as a viable option for future mobility in metropolitan areas in order to avoid terrestrial traffic congestion. However, a flight control information of a UAM, especially an unmanned UAM is very sensitive to latency. Hence MRC is not recommendable for UAM due to the inherent latency. We consider selection combining (SC) which has less latency rather than MRC as a combining technology in CoMP. This study derives the outage performance of UAM with selective CoMP in closed-form. The analytical results are compared and verified with that of the Monte Carlo simulation. The outage performances of a UAM in NOMA-NOMA and NOMA-OMA modes are compared. It is shown that the NOMA-OMA mode has better performance than the NOMA-NOMA mode irrespective of the given conditions, and has over 3 dB SNR gains under the given conditions. When the performance of UAM in the NOMA-NOMA mode is not satisfying, it is recommended to switch to the NOMA-OMA mode based on this study. © 2022.

In this study, virtual flights of the noise sources to mimic the drones and urban air mobilities are conducted to investigate the environmental impact by using the Gaussian beam tracing method implemented in an in-house solver Environmental Acoustic Ray Tracing Code, in which the dominant acoustic processes in outdoor applications are modelled. The solver also allows for modelling of sources with generic directivity patterns, which is beneficial for investigating the drone and urban air mobility noise produced by multiple rotors. Two examples of studying noise impact on building and realistic urban environment are conducted. The effects of the surface acoustic impedance, source type and flight path are investigated.

Results reveal that the general water resources system is quite satisfactory. The annual growth rate of CF is approximately 4.93%, mostly contributed by raw coal consumption. Natural resources consumption exceeds the ecosystem carrying capacity due to the increased ecological deficit (above 3.0 hm2/cap).

Thereby, not only different UAM aircraft architectures, but also fleet combinations, technology scenarios, and operational strategies are studied and evaluated for different success criteria.

However, studies on diel and seasonal fluctuations in seawater chemistry within these communities are still rare. Here, we characterized the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in diel and seasonal dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry and dissolved oxygen (DO) in three types of macroalgal habitats (UAM: ulvoid algal mat dominated, TAM: turf algal mat dominated, and SC: Sargassum horneri and coralline algae dominated). Our results show that diel fluctuations in carbonate parameters and DO varied significantly among habitat types and seasons due to differences in their biological metabolisms (photosynthesis and calcification) and each site’s hydrological characteristics. Specifically, carbonate parameters were most affected by biological metabolisms at the SC site, and by environmental variables at the UAM site. Also, we demonstrate that macroalgal communities reduced ocean acidification conditions when ocean temperatures supported photosynthesis and thereby the absorption of dissolved inorganic carbon. However, once temperatures exceeded the optimum ranges for macroalgae, respiration within these communities exceeded photosynthesis and increased CO2 concentrations, thereby exacerbating ocean acidification conditions. We conclude that the seawater carbonate chemistry is strongly influenced by the metabolisms of the dominant macroalgae within these different habitat types, which may, in turn, alter their buffering capacity against ocean acidification.

To tackle this problem, the present study developed a lightning zoning method for UAM aircraft with complex configurations and investigated the direct effects of lightning strikes on the prop-rotor blade of a UAM aircraft. First, computational simulation models for zoning analysis were developed for four representative UAM aircraft (one wingless multi-copter, one winged lift/cruise, and two winged vectored thrust types). The lightning zoning analysis identified the prop-rotor blade tips as Zone 1A, which has a high probability of initial lightning attachment. The direct effects of lightning strikes on a prop-rotor blade made of woven carbon/epoxy laminate were then investigated using both experimental and numerical methods. In general, the damage pattern of the simulation results agreed fairly well with the damage pattern in the experimental results. Moreover, it was shown that the prop-rotor blade of a relatively small UAM aircraft can suffer more damage, even after being struck by the lightning of the same intensity. In the future, since batteries, electric motors, inverters, and hydrogen fuel tanks, which are required by the new propulsion systems in UAM aircraft, will be increasingly used, designing a lightning protection system that properly reflects these changes will emerge as an important issue. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Lightning direct effects; Lightning test; Lightning zoning; Multi-physics simulation; Prop-rotor blade; Urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft"

Such vehicles feature a hybrid configuration with tiltrotors and fixed wings, enabling vertical takeoff/landing capability while attaining level flight range and endurance. A comprehensive nonlinear rigid-body dynamic model is developed by incorporating multiple tiltrotor dynamics and their gyroscopic and inertial coupling effects. A quasi-steady aerodynamic formulation is used to derive the aerodynamic loads on all lifting surfaces. In addition to the conventional control surfaces of the fixed-wing aircraft, the tiltrotor angular positions and rotational speeds are also considered additional control inputs in the derivation of nonlinear flight dynamic equations. These nonlinear equations are then linearized with respect to a set of trimmed conditions to generate the corresponding linear time-invariant state-space models, which are best suited for flight control design. In particular, to capture the critical dynamical behaviors during the transition from vertical to forward flight, the linear models are attained at various angular positions of the tiltrotors. These linear models are then utilized to develop a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model in which the tiltrotor angular position is considered the scheduling parameter. Subsequently, the adaptive model predictive control (MPC) methodology is used to design the flight controllers to achieve a stable and smooth transition flight. The numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed modeling and control approach. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Control; Flight mechanics; Tiltrotor; Urban air mobility"

A key factor diminishing travel time savings is vertiport processes. So far, vertiport throughput capacity has only been studied in a static manner using analytical methods, which has been found to be insufficient. This paper wants to increase the level of understanding of operational dynamics on vertiport airfields by being the first to apply agent-based simulation. For this purpose, an existing vertiport model consisting of pads, gates and stands was refined through two means. First, a sensitivity study with over 100 simulations was executed shedding light on the driving processes on a vertiport airfield. Second, an expert interview series with 17 participants was conducted, letting the experts evaluate the model and specify relevant parameter values. Three main results should find mention here: (1) Pad operations were identified to be most impactful on passenger delays. (2) Pad and gate processes have a threshold capacity beyond which delays increase exponentially. (3) A refined vertiport model is presented, including the 27 most relevant parameters and their value specification. In conclusion, this paper finds that optimized vertiport airfield design is crucial to UAM operations, and dynamic passenger and vehicle interactions cannot be neglected. © 2022 by the authors.

Most of the proposed elastic metasurfaces suffer from chromatic aberration, limited in a narrow bandwidth around the designed frequency. In this paper, overcoming the chromatic aberration, an ultra-broadband achromatic meta-slab (UAM) with subunits of gradient thickness is proposed to realize the refraction angle unchanged with the incident frequency. Based on the phase compensation principle, wavelength-dependent phase shifts for the UAM that realize achromaticity are obtained. In order to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical design, the transmitted wavefields are solved according to the phased array theory, and the results correspond with those obtained by the finite element (FE) simulations and experiments, which show that the refraction angle is unchanged for incident frequencies from 2 kHz to 8 kHz. Besides, the UAM is extended into a periodic meta-slab, and multifrequency achromaticity is realized. Our designed meta-slabs overcome the chromatic aberration by simple configurations, which have significance in the applications of vibration control, vibrational energy harvesting, and health monitoring.

We estimated perceived availability to and carriage of naloxone and explored factors associated with carriage among people who inject drugs (PWID) engaged with services in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Methods: Participants were PWID enrolled in the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Survey in 2019 who reported past-year injection drug use (n = 2,139). Recruitment occurred through specialist and community drug agencies located across the UK, excluding Scotland. Socio-demographic, behavioural and service use characteristics were self-reported. Participants were asked whether they carry naloxone (timeframe unspecified). If they answered ""no"", they were further asked whether it is available in their area. Perceived naloxone availability and carriage were estimated by requirement region, classified using the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 1. We used the Gelberg-Andersen Model of healthcare access to explore predisposing, enabling and need factors associated with regionally-aggregated naloxone carriage. Results: Perceived naloxone availability was ≥95% in all 11 regions; naloxone carriage varied (mean: 61.1; range: 48%-71%; P<0.01). Among predisposing factors, female gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21–1.91) was positively associated with naloxone carriage, whilst recruitment in Yorkshire and the Humber—relative to London—was negatively associated (AOR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.37–0.82). Among enabling factors, past-year contact with needle and syringe programmes (AOR: 1.74; 95%CI: 1.39–2.18) and currently receiving treatment for drug use (AOR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.24–2.46) were positively associated with naloxone carriage. Among need characteristics, past-month heroin injection, with or without past-month high-risk drinking or benzodiazepine use, was positively associated with carriage relative to no heroin injection (range of AORs: 1.71–2.58).

Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, date back to the first third of the twentieth century in aviation industry, when they were mostly used for military purposes. Nowadays, drones of various types and sizes are used for many purposes, such as precision agriculture, search and rescue missions, aerial photography, shipping and delivery, etc. Starting to operate in areas with low population density, drones are now looking for business in urban and suburban areas, in what is called urban air mobility (UAM).

This article presents an analysis of the Brazilian Civil Aviation Regulations (RBAC) No. 91 and 135, which address the minimum requirements for commercial operations of commuter and on-demand public passenger transport with airplanes with up to 19 seats. The objective of this article is to identify the technical and regulatory barriers to initiating the eVTOL operation in Brazil and to validate the current operational air traffic rules. After the analysis of the operational requirements and the current Air Traffic Management (ATM) infrastructure for helicopter operation, the minimum required and recommended navigation, communication and surveillance equipment are identified, as well as the main operational limitations for the operation of this type of aircraft in transporting passengers.

One peculiar aspect of some air-taxis will be their control by changing the rotational speed (rpm) of the rotors or propellers. In consequence, noise footprints may be stronger depending on the vehicle's temporary operational status than for common aircraft or helicopters. This study provides a statistical analysis of major noise metrics in flyover situations with changing rpm of a generic air-taxi system. The aircraft was equipped with electrical propulsion consisting of 15 propellers. Starting from a nominal rpm, which was assumed for a static flyover - as for example during a typical situation for noise certification - the rotational speed of the propellers was allowed to vary in a certain range. Because there are no detailed operational conditions available for any air-taxi system, the rpm distribution was assumed to follow a Gaussian profile. This assumption yielded acoustic results, with overall flyover numbers of 5,558 for the air-taxi in the simulations, which are going to be discussed. © ICA 2022.All rights reserved","air-taxi; UAM community noise"

A rotor analysis module for accurate noise prediction and a noise prediction module for a conceptual design stage are constructed. The rotor analysis module is developed for accurately predicting aerodynamic force distribution around rotor blades, thus enabling accurate noise prediction. This module consists of rotor analysis using BEMT or BET methods and CAMRAD II, and these methods exchange force distribution data, which is iterated in the module until aerodynamic force distribution by each method converges. The noise prediction module for a conceptual design stage uses compact loading assumption and dual compact loading assumption, therefore loading and thickness noise prediction are completed in a short time.

Electrical power, tilt-wing configuration and multiple propellers in tandem configuration (i.e. with the propellers placed one after the other) are the key features of such concept. In particular, the presence of multiple propellers working at close range introduces a new challenge, i.e. the investigation of the aerodynamic interaction between front propeller slipstreams and rear propellers. The present work aims to investigate the main physical aspects of this phenomenon in a typical eVTOL configuration in airplane mode. A dedicated wind tunnel testing campaign was performed to investigate deeply the interaction between two co-rotating tandem propellers at fixed axial distance and variable lateral separation. The tests included both thrust and torque measurements of the propellers and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) surveys. Load measurements showed a significant loss in the rear propeller performance as a function of the overlapping ratio between the propellers. Furthermore a dedicated spectral analysis of wind tunnel thrust signals outlined high amplitude fluctuations in partial overlapping configurations. The collected experimental results represent a reference database for the validation of numerical codes implemented during the design phase of such vehicles. In particular, some experimental data were compared with results obtained by the mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver DUST relying upon Vortex Particle Method (VPM) in order to enhance the comprehension of the phenomenon. The analysis of the numerical results allowed to access the flow behaviour involving the front propeller slipstream and the rear propeller disk, which is responsible of the massive losses experienced by the rear propeller.

Of the more than 500 designs that have been proposed in just the past few years, means of operation can vary greatly. Some designs incorporate hybrid lift/thrust sources, operating like helicopters at hover and low speeds and like airplanes at high speeds. Yet these vehicles do not fly at all like conventional aircraft in any flight regime, including possibly large changes in control and lift schemes as they transition between phases of flight. Civil certification of these modern aircraft will require a multi-stage flight test program that extends far beyond that currently employed by either rotorcraft or fixed-wing airplane testers. Use of advanced flight control methods and cockpit inceptors dictates advanced flight test methods. This paper discusses novel approaches to flight testing for advanced UAM designs that use vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) configurations, most likely employing electric motors (eVTOL). We start with a discussion of future flight testing using operationally oriented Handling Qualities Task Elements (HQTEs) to assess the overall pilot/flight control system/aerodynamic response characteristics for safe and effective operation.

This paper tackled the reliability and safety analysis of eVTOLs by using Six Sigma tools and the DMAIC (Design, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) process to establish design recommendations that can improve and facilitate the integration of eVTOLs to the public. Based on the gathered results, it is recommended that an eVTOL have a robust sensor system, frequent and rigorous maintenance schedules, and redundant airbags and air filters. If wing structures are utilized in the framework, it can be recommended that the eVTOL have them mounted on the lower half of the fuselage. To operate an eVTOL, it is recommended that the training process be meticulous, as human error was a leading cause in failure modes and autonomous flight will take time to fully mature. Furthermore, it is recommended that more battery testing for eVTOLs be conducted in order to achieve the high capacity needed for takeoff and landing.

However, public acceptance of drones still seems limited, with acceptance rates usually ranging around 50%. This contribution reports recent findings about the acceptance of civilian drones. Several factors influencing the public attitude towards drones are described here, such as the acceptance of certain drone applications and concerns about civil drones in general, with special consideration given to concerns about noise. Moreover, an effect of NIMBYism is confirmed, as even residents who envision using drones for the delivery of parcels or as air taxis frequently report that they would not agree to flights over their own homes. Special attention is paid to the problem of increasing noise annoyance among residents near airports and its implications for the upscaling of drone operations, as well as potential countermeasures. Finally, the need for regulation is discussed, as well as potential measures to meet certain challenges of advanced aerial mobility. Providing consistent and transparent information about drones by stakeholders is seen as basic measure to increase acceptance. Besides defining aspects like topographical conditions, urban areas and time restrictions by regulation, providing residents with tools for participatory noise sensing can also be a viable measure to increase public support for advanced air mobility. © 2022 The Author(s).","AAM; acceptance; drones; NIMBY; Noise annoyance; UAM"

They proposed a new way of life, following the publication of a manifesto in 1934. Thanks to the arrival of the Front Populaire government, the UAM was invited to build a pavilion in the International Exhibition of Arts and Technology in Modern Life, held in Paris in 1937. The building, designed by Georges-Henri Pingusson with Frantz-Philippe Jourdain and André Louis, was a response to the desire for balance, logic and purity enshrined in the UAM manifesto, made of low-cost prefabricated elements. It implemented the synthesis of the arts (painting, sculpture, graphic arts, furniture, etc.), so cherished by the group. In the interior architecture gallery, social concern was apparent in the study of minimum space, by exploring retractable or multifunctional furniture. Art for all also took shape for the first time in the form of a bazaar, which consisted of grouping together objects usually on sale in shops but adapted by the artists in order to bring together everyday objects of quality at an affordable price. Finally, the UAM exhibited metal school furniture, the result of a collaboration with the Technical Office for the Use of Steel (OTUA) to demonstrate the potential of the material. For André Hermant, the 1937 pavilion was the conclusion of the first years of UAM's activities, which he described as having been an era of struggle. The presentation of the UAM in 1937 was a clear illustration of the group's ideological position in the European artistic context and their last event before the Second World War. © Design: Social Commitment and Quality of Life, Proceedings.All rights reserved.",

Recent technological and operational improvements give reason to believe that UAS safety and performance capabilities are maturing. However, there is still the need for establishing a systematic agreement between UAS safety policies with commonly accepted UAS Safety Risk Management processes.

Most of it are electric vertical takeoff and landing, eVTOL, vehicles. For these hovering configurations, the use of contra-rotating propellers allows both small dimension together with sufficient thrust, hence good performance to size compromise. By that, the contra-rotating configuration becomes crucial concerning its performance potential for these vehicles. Unfortunately, performance of contra-rotating configuration is inferior compared to an equivalent single-rotating propeller. Moreover, its acoustic signature is worse, which contradicts the restrictive noise regulation. All of these requires meticulous design of the propulsion system, confronting both its performance and acoustic characteristics. This requires introduction of numerical optimization into the design process, which enables extracting the configuration full potential. Contra-rotating propeller configuration is non-trivial concerning optimal design. This is due to the complex nature of its aerodynamic analysis which implicates also on its noise characteristics. The current effort harnesses several models into unified design framework, which allows optimization of such configuration. The optimization environment is based on ESTECO’s modeFRONTIER which incorporates all analysis into the design framework. Using CFD-based analyses is doomed to fail, as part of optimization procedure, due to its very high computer resource requirement. Thus, aerodynamic analysis is based on simple and effective blade-element model, and acoustic prediction is based on standard discretization of the acoustic wave equation together with super-position of the forward and rear propeller contributions. Electric model and motor/propeller matching is based on simple electric relations which are implemented twice for each propeller in the contra-rotating configuration.

However, due to the high-level power consumption of eVTOL and only having air flight mode, this kind of aircraft has a severe shortage of cruising range. To improve the endurance and dynamic performance, the flying car designed in this paper added a ground driving mode based on eVTOL and used distributed ducted fans to provide lift. And the influence of different power transmission routes on the dynamic and economic performance of the flying car was analyzed. On this basis, the overall take-off weight of the flying car was estimated through an iterative algorithm, and parameter design and power system matching for each part of the components were conducted. Finally, this paper used MATLAB/Simulink to build a flying car power system model and verified the performance of the flying car through simulation. The results show that the ducted fan is superior to the isolated fan in providing both lift and noise control. The maximum flying speed of the flying car that adopts the power transmission route of four in-wheel motors and four-rotor motors is 5.1% higher than that of four wheel-side motors combined with mechanical transmission structures.

Based on the velocity observer, an IBVS controller using onboard camera of the UAM platform is proposed for moving target tracking without velocity measurement. Then, the barrier Lyapunov function is introduced into the UAM platform IBVS controller to ensure the safety of target tracking. Besides, another virtual camera is constructed on manipulator end-effector to compensate for the tracking error of the UAM platform. As a benefit, the eye-to-hand onboard camera ensures the global view of the UAM, and the eye-in-hand virtual camera of the manipulator ensures the accuracy of the grasping task.

That knowledge captured in compliance standards - can be tested for predictable outcomes. Autonomy that involves learning systems tend to be dynamic and may continuously be adapting to their environment. Such continuous adaptation has inherent unknown risks depending upon the guardrails imposed on the learning systems. Design assurance and use of traditional standards are inadequate for these dynamic systems.Assurance Cases are used to present an argument for the assurance of systems. Dynamic systems require that assurance cases be continuously validated. One method of validation is using real time collection of Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) which are crafted during the development of the system. This paper presents the need for SPIs and methods for creating and nurturing the SPIs to help all stakeholders. This method shadows regulations and allows risk-based approvals that may be applied for both conventional and for novel technology.Aviation is facing enormous growth in autonomous technology, reuse of components of unknown pedigree, and new aircraft designs that do not fit into Type classification. Mitigations are more heavily connected to operations, training, and other components of the ecosystem itself. The challenge is to make an assurance case for vehicles within the ecosystem. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by dynamically changing autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions to build safer systems.UL 4600, a Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products applies to fully autonomous road vehicles. The goal-based, technology-neutral features of UL 4600 have been extended to apply to aviation. So applied, the assurance process is adaptable to innovation and discovery while encouraging the current practices of standards compliance and taking a System of Systems (SoS) view. It proposes an assurance case that is an organized argument that a system is acceptable for its intended use with respect to specified concerns (such as safety, security, correctness). This paper gives guidance for validation of an assurance case through monitoring SPI within the operational context. The method by monitoring safety performance indices in the operational environment provides continued validation even as the ecosystem, components and controls change.For approval of novel systems including UAS and AAM, with features that do not lend themselves to traditional compliance methods, regulators have embraced the Safety Continuum perspective, which focuses on safety performance achieving expected outcomes. The performance-based assurance methods can be used with initially wider performance margins for certification of novel products, components of unknown pedigree, and autonomous vehicles. As the performance range is better known the margins can be decreased.Further, this paper recognizes that a one-time initial approval/acceptance is not adequate for learning systems and novel features. The continued validation through performance supports fast-paced development and product evolution. The initial assurance case for a product can limit risk through a closed environment until the margin for some unknowns is validated. for example, if the performance of collision avoidance function using new technology is not known, larger alert limits may be implemented until more confidence is gained after validating the assurance case via SPIs.The approach of monitored SPI throughout the life of the product is now feasible with the aid of big data processing. The aviation industry is already using similar methods for identifying maintenance problems. As systems grow more autonomous, more machine-to-machine exchanges are involved, making it easy to extend the monitoring and prediction practices to SPI.The method also allows for variants and derivatives of the baseline to have their own assurance case within the context of the baseline argument. The key is replacing design approval with through-life assurance that connects continuous operational safety into both the design and airworthiness determinations. The determination is predicated on the monitored SPIs and predicted performance of the product remaining consistent with the assurance argument predictions. This enables even complex automated products to be audited for airworthiness with an evolving ecosystem based on monitored and predictive data.Another advantage of the performance-based assurance case is the public comprehensibility of safety. With SPIs and predictions of performance the automobile segment has paved the way for public scrutiny of automated vehicles. The use of SPIs in aeronautical product assurance will facilitate transparency. This could be accomplished through appropriate dashboards to aid public perception and explain events and precautions taken during the evolution toward more autonomous aviation vehicles. This could reflect a stepwise evolution of complexity.This paper explores how the aviation industry can apply performance-based assurance case methods to assure new and novel as well as systems of unknown pedigree.

The purpose is to align the rigor of oversight to the public expectations. An aircraft, its variants or derivatives may be used in operations with different expectations. The differences in mission might bring immutable risks for some applications that reuse or revise the original aircraft type design. The continuum enables a more agile design approval process for innovations in the context of a dynamic ecosystems, addressing the creation of variants for different sectors and needs. Since an aircraft type design can be reused in various operations under part 91 or 135 with different mission risks the assurance case will have many branches reflecting the variants and derivatives.This paper proposes a model for the holistic, performance-based, through-life safety assurance case that focuses applicant and oversight alike on achieving the safety outcomes. This paper describes the application of goal-based, technology-neutral features of performance-based assurance cases extending the philosophy of UL 4600, to the Safety Continuum. This paper specifically addresses component reuse including third-party vehicle modifications and changes to operational concept or eco-system.

The model provides the context to assure mitigated risk are consistent with an operation's place on the safety continuum, while allowing the applicant to reuse parts of the assurance argument to innovate variants or derivatives.

This is accompanied by the trend towards software-intensive avionics systems due to the requirement for complex and computationally expensive algorithms. Considering the successful application of agile developments in the software domain, one might conclude that the agile paradigm would be the perfect fit to address these issues. However, for highly safety-critical domains such as aviation, multiple conflicts with the agile paradigm exist. Especially the constraint to follow rigorous and well documented processes contradicts the ideas of agile. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive and well documented, but still flexible process is necessary. Accordingly, this paper proposes a first step towards such an agile safety-guided design, by combining Model-Based Systems Engineering with the System-Theoretic Process Analysis. Particularly, focus is placed on enabling an iterative safety-guided design by providing functionality to track design changes to the corresponding safety artifacts. This automated functionality is enabled by a formalized execution of the safety analysis. At first glance, formalization sounds like a contradiction to the agile paradigm. However, we argue that formality and agility are not necessarily contradicting each other. Our theory is that moving the focus of formality from the human activities to the assisting functionality even increases overall agility. The iterative safety-guided design and resulting identification of safety improvements is demonstrated with examples of a flight assistance system. © 2022 IEEE.","Agile; CPS; Design Changes; Formality; MBSE; Safety; STPA; SysML; Tracing; UAM"

As novel products with autonomous functions and interactions between component systems are adopted, the number of interdependencies within and among the SoS grows. These interactions may not always be obvious. Understanding how proposed products (component systems) fit into the context of a larger SoS is essential to promote the safe use of new as well as conventional technology.UL 4600, is a Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products specifically written for completely autonomous Load vehicles. The goal-based, technology-neutral features of this standard make it adaptable to other industries and applications.This paper, using the philosophy of UL 4600, gives guidance for creating an assurance case for products in an SoS context. An assurance argument is a cogent structured argument concluding that an autonomous aircraft system possesses all applicable through-life performance and safety properties. The assurance case process can be repeated at each level in the SoS: aircraft, aircraft system, unmodified components, and modified components. The original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) develops the assurance case for the whole aircraft envisioned in the type certification process. Assurance cases are continuously validated by collecting and analyzing Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs). SPIs provide predictive safety information, thus offering an opportunity to improve safety by preventing incidents and accidents. Continuous validation is essential for risk-based approval of autonomously evolving (dynamic) systems, learning systems, and new technology. System variants, derivatives, and components are captured in a subordinate assurance case by their developer. These variants of the assurance case inherently reflect the evolution of the vehicle-level derivatives and options in the context of their specific target ecosystem. These subordinate assurance cases are nested under the argument put forward by the OEM of components and aircraft, for certification credit.It has become a common practice in aviation to address design hazards through operational mitigations. It is also common for hazards noted in an aircraft component system to be mitigated within another component system. Where a component system depends on risk mitigation in another component of the SoS, organizational responsibilities must be stated explicitly in the assurance case. However, current practices do not formalize accounting for these dependencies by the parties responsible for design; consequently, subsequent modifications are made without the benefit of critical safety-related information from the OEMs. The resulting assurance cases, including 3rd party vehicle modifications, must be scrutinized as part of the holistic validation process.When changes are made to a product represented within the assurance case, their impact must be analyzed and reflected in an updated assurance case. An OEM can facilitate this by integrating affected assurance cases across their customer's supply chains to ensure their validity. The OEM is expected to exercise the sphere-of-control over their product even if it includes outsourced components. Any organization that modifies a product (with or without assurance argumentation information from other suppliers) is accountable for validating the conditions for any dependent mitigations. For example, the OEM may manage the assurance argumentation by identifying requirements and supporting SPI that must be applied in all component assurance cases. For their part, component assurance cases must accommodate all spheres-of-control that mitigate the risks they present in their respective contexts. The assurance case must express how interdependent mitigations will collectively assure the outcome. These considerations are much more than interface requirements and include explicit hazard mitigation dependencies between SoS components. A properly integrated SoS assurance case reflects a set of interdependent systems that could be independently developed..Even in this extremely interconnected environment, stakeholders must make accommodations for the independent evolution of products in a manner that protects proprietary information, domain knowledge, and safety data. The collective safety outcome for the SoS is based on the interdependence of mitigations by each constituent component and could not be accomplished by any single component. This dependency must be explicit in the assurance case and should include operational mitigations predicated on people and processes.Assurance cases could be used to gain regulatory approval of conventional and new technology. They can also serve to demonstrate consistency with a desired level of safety, especially in SoSs whose existing standards may not be adequate. This paper also provides guidelines for preserving alignment between component assurance cases along a product supply chain, and the respective SoSs that they support. It shows how assurance is a continuous process that spans product evolution through the monitoring of interdependent requirements and SPI. The interdependency necessary for a successful assurance case encourages stakeholders to identify and formally accept critical interconnections between related organizations. The resulting coordination promotes accountability for safety through increased awareness and the cultivation of a positive safety culture. © 2022 IEEE.","Acceptable Safety; AI; Autonomous Systems; Certification; Complexity; Dynamic Systems; Epistemic Safety; Goal-based regulatory Oversight; Machine Learning; Performance Based Assurance Case; Safety; Safety Continuum; Safety Performance Indicators; Through-life Assurance Case; UAM; UAS; Uncertainty in Performance"

This paper presents a design for corridors in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area that attempts to minimize air traffic controller interactions with UAM pilots and operators. The corridor and vertiports are then analyzed with respect to Class B separation criteria and wake advisory criteria. The results show that for the corridors designed for the DFW area and presented in this research, in some cases Class B separation criteria are not available between UAM corridors and legacy traffic due to the geometry of the airport. It shows that wake advisory criteria were not met for some segments in North Flow traffic but were generally met in South Flow.

HDV aims to develop an integrated automation architecture to support terminal area flight operations. The HDV simulations and flight tests address safety, integration, and operational challenges, while integrated systems and software demonstrate design readiness, robustness, and interoperability. During the initial HDV simulation in 2021, a prototype traffic management tool developed by NASA called the Fleet Management Interface (FMI) was tested. FMI was designed to introduce an advanced level of human-automation interaction to aid both Ground control systems operators (GCSOs) and fleet managers (FMs) in remotely managing flights under their ownership. In a human-in-the-loop simulation, a usability study was conducted with the FMI to identify optimal approaches for displaying information to human operators using subjective measures of usability, workload, situation awareness, risk, and user experience, along with qualitative feedback. This study consisted of task analysis in which GCSO and FM subjects used an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) environment to develop and execute a plan for two different traffic scenarios of remotely controlled vehicles. In each scenario, a remotely controlled vehicle completed a takeoff, active flight, and landing sequence while simulated traffic flew in the background at a rate of 20 operations per hour. In the first scenario, the controlled vehicle flew a nominal route with takeoff and landing at the same vertiport. In the second scenario, the controlled vehicle started on the nominal route, then diverted to an unplanned location mid-flight. Results showed that self-reported performance, usability, and situation awareness ratings of FMI were moderately high and perceived risk was low. Furthermore, participants described improvements that could be made to create a better user experience. For example, users suggested having the ability to review routes before assigning them, and adding more detail to operation state messages. The results from this study will inform future development of the FMI with the end goal of creating a reference automation tool for airspace management procedures in AAM.

We propose a hierarchical method to design a vertiport network for multi-modal UAM with multiple-seat aircraft based on the passenger demand. Our objective is to determine vertiport locations and assign passengers to maximize their travel time benefit from using multi-modal UAM. The proposed hierarchical vertiport network design method consists of two steps: (1) The origins and the destinations of the UAM passengers are clustered by the k-median algorithm, which divides the whole metro region into fully-connected main sectors; (2) The passengers in the main sectors are subdivided into groups whose centers serve as the vertiports. The passenger consolidation time and vertiport operational capacity are constrained in these two steps. We implement the proposed method in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are approximately 2.8 million trips between 5 a.m. and 12 p.m. 163,098 trips are chosen as potential UAM trips and simulated with the rest of the driving trips.

Thus, drones would be a further component to existing traffic and yet another stimulus in urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how urban air mobility (UAM) is perceived by the society. Will the presence of drones be tolerated by the general public? To address this question, a Virtual Reality (VR) study was conducted, which investigates how the factors flight height, visual density and drone noise affect the acceptance of passers-by in an urban scenario. Furthermore, it explored how people perceive the landing of an air taxi nearby. The sample of the study comprises 47 participants.The results indicate some significant effects of flight height and visual density on acceptance, but no effect of drone noise was observed. Compared to the baseline scenario without drones, the flight height and visual density scenarios with drones were rated more negative. The same applies for the air taxi scenario. After participating in the simulation, participants' worries about noise and privacy significantly decreased. More than half of the participants reported that their attitudes toward drones had changed following the simulation and tended to improve. © 2022 IEEE.","acceptance; air taxi; drones; flight height; noise; simulation; urban air mobility (UAM); virtual reality (VR); visual density"

UASs are being used in the military for a variety of applications to include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) as well as resupply. Larger scale Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) vehicles are also receiving attention. Many of these systems use electric motors with a fixed pitch propeller. More efficient, quiet propellers are needed if these systems are to operate near populated areas. Selection of an appropriate airfoil is critical to satisfy these requirements. This study proposes seven guidelines to evaluate airfoils: 1) sufficient thickness, 2) high lift coefficient, 3) high maximum lift to drag ratio, 4) broad peak at the maximum lift-to-drag ratio, 5) linear lift curve slope over propeller's airfoil operating angleof-attack (AOA) range, 6) low drag over the operating AOA range, and 7) selecting the appropriate Reynolds number for airfoil design aerodynamic data. The Clark Y, GM15, GOE 225, GOE 358 and S1223 airfoils were analyzed using the selection guidelines. Propellers were designed for each airfoil using Blade Element Momentum Theory and tested in a low-speed wind tunnel. The aerodynamic performance of each propeller is reported as well as the noise generated in the near field. The GM15 required the lowest mechanical power to meet the on-design conditions of T=2.5 lbf at a freestream velocity of 44 ft/s. This propeller also had the lowest measured peak Sound Pressure Level. While no airfoil satisfies all the selection guidelines perfectly, having an awareness of these guidelines will help with the selection of a suitable propeller airfoil for the mission and design point.

In addition, it has revealed the interest of traditional airplane and helicopter manufacturers in this new technology, all the while highlighting the emergence of new players developing their respective versions of electric-powered VTOLs (eVTOL). The perspective of eVTOLs going into service in the coming years for the transport of passengers raises new safety concerns. Indeed, it is necessary to ensure the reliability and safety aspects of those aircraft systems that will be flying under new operational missions, differing from current fixed wing (airplanes) and rotorcraft (helicopters) aircraft. At the same time, the evolution of aircraft systems monitoring technology is making it possible to acquire increasing amounts of data. The high complexity of new systems, combined with the huge amount of data provided, can make the decision-making process more difficult for pilots. Machine learning makes it possible to evaluate this data and improve reliability and safety. Even as the number of aeronautical accidents has decreased over the last years, 60–80% of those accidents are the result of human failure. In the initial implementation and operation stages of eVTOLs, machine learning (ML) can support pilots by using aircraft data to predict system failures and contribute to improve reliability and safety. Then, at an advanced stage of eVTOL operation, ML may help reduce human interaction with the aircraft, paving the way toward fully autonomous aircraft. The association of ML with technologies such as Digital Twins and 6G networks has the potential to enable safe and reliable autonomous flight. However, the introduction of eVTOLs will also increase air traffic in highly populated areas and thus needs to be studied to support the incorporation of the future autonomous aircraft.

New designs of aerial vehicles are being developed to meet industry needs but often neglect the aerodynamic characteristics and the effects of interacting rotors. This work focuses on predicting rotor behavior and understanding the importance of the rotor wake interaction for future urban air mobility (UAM) designs. The Multirotor Test Bed (MTB) project was initiated at NASA Ames Research center to support the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project to study rotorcraft performance specifically for multirotor aircraft. The MTB is a modular multirotor test stand that makes testing feasible for up to six rotors at different angles and rotor arrangements, including Tall and Short configurations at different horizontal and vertical rotor separation distances. The MTB was tested in the U.S Army’s 7- by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center in late 2019. This work focuses on exploring the impact of aerodynamic interactions between the MTB rotors using the Comprehensive Hierarchical Aeromechanics Rotorcraft Model (CHARM) software. The CHARM software is capable of modeling Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft aerodynamics in maneuvering and steady flight conditions. CHARM allows the user to define flow and body characteristics, including the rotor geometry, aerodynamic conditions, wind tunnel speed, and airfoil tables as inputs. As the first step, a single MTB rotor was simulated in hover, and the results were compared with wind tunnel test data to confirm the CHARM parameters. Once the accurate performance was verified, the MTB rotors were simulated in forward flight, and each rotor was trimmed to the measured thrust. The simulation variables include one, two, four, and six rotors at the Short and Tall configurations, with MTB pitch angles of 0, -5, and -10 degrees. The MTB was simulated with and without wind tunnel walls. These results demonstrate the rotor wake interaction and its impact on rotor performance. This information also helps determine which configurations should be explored for future wind tunnel tests. Copyright © 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.",

Propeller aeroacoustic studies have heavily depended upon experiments and low fidelity numerical frameworks. Wind tunnel and flight testing are expensive and time-consuming. Numerical schemes based on low-fidelity aerodynamic solvers such as blade element momentum theory or other modeling methods may not adequately account for the complex aerodynamics of the transient maneuvers. Therefore, this study attempts to create a more robust high-fidelity framework to simulate the aeroacoustics of propellers that undergo unsteady non-periodic maneuvers by coupling a Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Furthermore, it uses the framework to study propeller transition from hover to forward flight, while reducing the rotational speed. The results obtained from the unsteady simulation are compared with those obtained from quasi-steady simulations at intermediate steps of the transition.

From the use of multirotor configurations to the use of variable RPM for thrust control of rigid, propeller-style rotors, many of the UAM concepts observed in industry have departed significantly from traditional VTOL designs. While such novel vehicle types may provide beneficial mission capability and efficiency, they have not been as thoroughly studied as more traditional configurations, and new aeromechanics analysis must be conducted. Operating states such as low-tip-speed rotors in edgewise flight may prove to yield unusual aeroelastic behavior and must be investigated. In the present work, a rotorcraft comprehensive analysis is used to analyze the aeroelastic characteristics of a fixed-pitch, variable RPM rotor in edgewise flight. The rotor model, a three-bladed, fixed pitch propeller, was developed in a previous work. Floquet theory analysis is used to capture the periodic nature of the dynamics. Parameters such as rotor rotational speed, forward flight speed, and blade torsion stiffness are varied and their impact on performance and stability are assessed. A value of torsion stiffness is identified to yield stable flight from 0-100 kts with a wide range of RPM values.

An accurate airfoil table is critical in the design and testing process for rotorcraft. With multiple flow solvers available and flow conditions of multirotor UAM vehicles potentially covering a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, a documented approach for developing airfoil tables is needed. Using benchmark data from legacy airfoil tables and wind tunnel tests for comparison, simulations for a comprehensive test matrix could guide rotorcraft design engineers in generating their own airfoil tables using the XFOIL and OVERFLOW solvers. The motivation for this study is to investigate flow solver features to develop a best practices document for airfoil table generation. The study uses the OVERFLOW and XFOIL flow solvers, coupled with the airfoil table generator AFTGen, to analyze three airfoils for a specific Reynolds numbers flow regime and provide details on how well each flow solver performs within a specific angle of attack range, Mach number range, Reynolds number range, and in different flow conditions, such as turbulent and transitional flow. OVERFLOW analyses in AFTGen for fully turbulent and transition flow are compared with XFOIL results and experimental test data for the section lift, section drag, and pressure coefficients. XFOIL ultimately yields results that are accurate within the linear angle of attack range and below a Mach number of 0.4 but tends to overpredict lift and underpredict drag unless the flow is in the compressible regime. XFOIL cannot accurately model stall and post-stall conditions due to the nature of the solver. This is evident in nearly every case run with XFOIL, where the linear range is usually predicted acceptably and the lift coefficient is overpredicted as the stall angle of attack is approached (with the exception being the generally poor correlation with most of the SSC-A09 cases). OVERFLOW is limited at low Mach numbers, and appears to perform best at Mach numbers of 0.4 and above. The exploration of airfoil table generation using XFOIL and OVERFLOW yielded moderately successful results for the NACA 0012 airfoil, reasonably good results for the RC(4)-10 airfoil, and less accurate results for the SSC-A09 airfoil.

One potential path for deriving a high-fidelity, low cost rotor model is with data-driven surrogate modeling. In this study, an initial investigation is taken to apply a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced order model (ROM) for the purpose of pressure distribution prediction. In this study, a POD ROM was derived to produce distributed pressure predictions on rotor blades subjected to topology change due to variation in twist and taper ratio. Rotor twist was varied between 0◦, 10◦, 20◦, and 30◦ while taper ratio was varied between 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. All rotors consisted of a single blade. The POD ROM was validated for three demonstration cases; a high thrust rotor in hover, a low thrust rotor in hover, and a rotor in forward flight with a flight speed of M = 0.1. Results showed highly accurate distributed load predictions could be achieved at minimal computational cost. Computational cost for hovering blade surface pressure modeling was reduced from 12 hours on 440 cores to 10−5 seconds on a single core. For blade in forward flight cost was reduced from 20 hours on 440 cores to 0.6 seconds on a single core. For cases of high thrust and low thrust rotors, POD ROM was used to undergo a design optimization of the rotor such that figure of merit was maximized.

However, to achieve precise ultrasound segmentation is still a challenge caused by the ambiguous lesion boundary and imaging artifacts such as speckles and shadowing noise. Considering that the pixels with high uncertainty generally distributing in the boundary regions of prediction maps, are likely to overlap with the confused regions of ultrasound, we proposed an uncertainty-aware cascade network. Our network uses the confidence map to evaluate the uncertainty of each pixel to enhance the segmentation of ambiguous boundary. On the one hand, the confidence map fuses with the ultrasound features and predicted mask using the adaptive fusion module (AFM) which enriches the context features from different modalities. In addition, the uncertainty attention module (UAM) is proposed based on the confidence map. This module focuses on the influential features with cross attention constrained by the uncertainty of pixels which can extract the localized features of confused ultrasound regions. On the other hand, the recurrent edge correction module (RECM) further improves the segmentation of ambiguous boundary.

The present experiment was carried out at six sites viz; Multan, Faisalabad, Khanpur, Bahawalpur, Vehari and Sahiwal in the Punjab province during Kharif 2020-21. The main objectives of the study were to quantifythe GEI component of variation and to assess the yield stability of recently bred upland cotton strains across test environments. Twenty-one cotton strains were sown according to a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis illustrated that additive effects of genotypes, environments and multiplicative effects (GEI) were significant at (p<0.01). Test sites accounted for the biggest share (74.1%) of the variability, followed by GEI (17.2%) and strains (8.7%), respectively. The first four interaction principal components (IPC) were significant at (p<0.01) wherein the first two IPCs captured (68.4%) of the GEI cumulatively. Strain ST06 (FH-492) won four environs and was declared the overall winner of this trial. The Vehari location was the best location for cotton multi-environment trials (MET) due to the bearing of minimum IPC-1 score. The correlation coefficient between strains in IPC1 was (0.81) and sites in PC1 was (0.76). Strain ST08 (BH-224) bears a yield edge of (84.5%) over general winner strain ST (06) FH-492 at the site of Multan due to micro adaptations. Genotype selection index (GSI: A non-parametric approach to determine yield stability) discriminated ST02 (WEAL-AG-10), ST05 (MNH-1050), ST09 (VH-418) and ST19 (UAM-20) as stable yielder strains bearing the lowest GSI value (11).

To deliver safe and computationally efficient guidance for UAS operations, we explore the use of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to lead autonomous UAS to their destinations while bypassing obstacles through continuous control. The proposed scenario state representation and reward function can map the continuous state space to continuous control for both heading angle and speed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework, we conducted numerical experiments with static and moving obstacles.

Successful pilot intervention will be especially important for handling emergency procedures. This paper demonstrates the use of human-centric flight guidance concepts to mitigate the effects of non-catastrophic failures in future VTOL UAM aircraft. Specifically, a single failure in the lateral steering function of an automatic flight control system is considered. A new waypoint guidance law is proposed to generate the required roll command to manually steer the aircraft toward a predefined safe landing zone. Two display concepts are proposed to aid the manual execution of the roll steering command: a head-down display (HDD), and a head-mounted display (HMD). The guidance law and the display concepts were integrated into a high-fidelity, wide field-of-view rotorcraft simulation environment. Human-in-the-loop experiments were performed with non-pilot test subjects. The effectiveness of the guidance law and display concepts along with the associated piloting performance and human factor impacts were assessed. The results indicated that all test subjects were able to reach a close vicinity of the final waypoint. The HMD induced lower workload whereas the HDD resulted in better tracking performance.

The key to the visual UAM approaching lies in object tracking, while current UAM tracking typically relies on costly model-based methods. Besides, UAM approaching often confronts more severe object scale variation issues, which makes it inappro-priate to directly employ state-of-the-art model-free Siamese-based methods from the object tracking field. To address the above problems, this work proposes a novel Siamese network with pairwise scale-channel attention (SiamSA) for vision-based UAM approaching. Specifically, SiamSA consists of a pairwise scale-channel attention network (PSAN) and a scale-aware anchor proposal network (SA-APN). PSAN acquires valuable scale information for feature processing, while SA-APN mainly attaches scale awareness to anchor proposing. Moreover, a new tracking benchmark for UAM approaching, namely UAMT100, is recorded with 35K frames on a flying UAM platform for evaluation. Exhaustive experiments on the benchmarks and real-world tests validate the efficiency and practicality of SiamSA with a promising speed.

The thermal formability of TP composites opens the door to fastener-free assemblies which has the benefit of reducing weight without compromising joint strength or requiring extensive co-curing. TP structures also offer a more rapid consolidation, allowing high-rate manufacturing, as needed by the urban air mobility market (UAM).

Considering the difference in flight characteristics, the aircraft performance is fully integrated into the design process of strategic deconfliction components. With this concept, the multi-resolution structure for the low-altitude airspace organization, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for the speed profile generation, and dynamic separation minima enable efficient UAM operations.

They can be used for aerial manipulation tasks such as object retrieval from confined and hard-to-reach spaces. The coupled dynamics between the arm and the base and also the limited flight time would require the development and implementation of optimal motion planning and robust flight control strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated planning and control strategy for object retrieval. A new kinodynamic version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*), called Lazy-Steering-RRT*, is developed for planning UAM&#x2019;s motion from its start to a pre-grasp state, while keeping the motion of the arm to a minimum. This planning can be carried out on the fly by using Machine-Learning-based techniques to construct the edges in the search tree in a time-efficient way. This facilitates re-planning, as the environment is gradually sensed by limited-range sensors onboard. Once the UAM reaches the pre-grasp state at the end of the motion cycle, an RRT approach is then utilized, where motions of the base and the arm are coordinated for reaching and grasping the object. A novel partitioned control approach, composed of model predictive and PID controllers, is utilized for the UAM to track the planned trajectory. The overall motion planning and control algorithms have been implemented in simulation using Multibody Physics Engines and a number of representative simulation runs are presented. Our results show that the approach is effective in successfully executing the object retrieval task even in confined spaces. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This research was motivated by the problem of retrieving an object from a confined space such as that in a collapsed building using an unmanned aerial manipulator.

In this paper, we suggest some novel approaches on both planning and control aspects of the navigation and also on the integration of these two modules to provide a navigation package that meets all the requirements in the retrieval task. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally-light, therefore, well suited for on the fly planning and control.

However, additional research is necessary to predict future UAM concepts using profitability rather than cost. Traditional design and allocation studies leverage cost models to define direct operating costs as a means to estimate the likelihood of successful programs. The traditional approach is useful for established operations (e.g., commercial, business, and general aviation); however, because UAM (or reimagined on-demand mobility via eVTOL) operations are not established, there is an opportunity to expand approaches to look at profitability to ensure the expected solutions address market needs.

Noise contours are computed for baseline route and alternative route design given the desired UAM demand level. The impact of UAM fleet noise is predicted based on predicted number of people and noise-sensitive facilities located inside the noise contours. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

For example, sUAS operations captured in this research include surveying and photography, policing, firefighting, agricultural spraying, search and rescue, and many others. These operations represent many legacy areas in general aviation. In fact, many of the future applications of autonomous or remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) will encompass even more, such as aeromedical, heavy lift, and even low-capacity transport with urban air mobility (UAM). To that end, it is essential that safety in the industry be regularly and continuously reviewed. In this research we present a review of the current data set of RPAS safety occurrences (accidents and incidents) in the Australian Transport Safety Board dataset, from May 2008 to July 2021, consisting of 429 cases. These are analyzed in terms of their key categorical properties; specifically, occurrence type, occurrence category, type of operation, and phase of flight. Findings show that accidents account for over 75% of occurrences, likely indicating the under reporting of incidents. Collisions with terrain accounted for almost 90% of occurrences, and similarly 90% of occurrences occurred during maneuvering and not during critical phases of flight like crewed occurrences. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The designs of eVTOL configurations are determined by their mission profile, which we found to be over-simplified at many points in the current scientific literature. There is a gap of understanding which impact the mission profile has on travel time and energy demand. In this paper we review various mission designs, formulate a 5-segment flight profile (including vertical descent, climb, cruise, descent and vertical approach) and apply it on a fleet level of up to 200,000 UAM trips. The demand data originates from the upper Bavaria region study OBUAM. In a sensitivity study we vary cruise altitude, height of the vertical flight segments and the climb & descent angles for two vehicle configurations: a fixed-wing tilt-rotor concept and a multicopter concept. The main findings for the fixed-wing concept are that the height of the vertical flight segments and the cruise altitude should be as low as possible and small climb angles (below 7 degrees) should be avoided. The multicopter concept, however, is penalized by fast forward flight while being comparatively insensitive to both cruise altitude and height of the vertical segments. Further, we found a trade-off between time-and energy-optimal flight with the a energy-optimized climb/descent angle around 10 degree. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A major part of the solution towards achieving the UAM/AAM vision will be assured and trusted autonomy that enable human operators and passengers to interact with autonomous systems that transport humans and cargo with high assurance of safety, security and reliability. Given the complex interactions among the autonomy algorithms, human, environment and UAM control, there is a need for vehicle-level monitoring that detects emerging hazard scenarios. The data gathered from UAM systems that would help detect emerging hazards will be diverse: from highly-regular information (onboard flight controls) to irregular streaming information (weather, real time population dynamics). This paper presents a systematic approach for developing model-and data-driven hazard monitoring framework which we call pervasive monitoring. The aim of pervasive monitoring is to “comprehensively"" observe a Cyber Physical System (CPS) at different architectural levels to ensure its safety and security with respect to its intended operation. Since there is no single monitor type that solves complex in-time hazard detection problems for UAM, we assert that several classes of monitors are needed to address this challenge.

In this paper we seek to determine how DCB can be implemented to ensure safe and efficient UAM operations in coordination with a tactical deconfliction system. We use simulations to explore the safety of representative UAM operations applying tactical deconfliction methods, and estimate airspace resource capacities that could be applied, using DCB, to ensure safe and efficient UAM operations. We apply this approach to determine airspace capacity in two baseline route structures-simulating merging flows and crossing flows respectively-which are then applied to a hypothetical UAM network in New York City. The benefits of DCB to support tactical deconfliction for safety assurance across a range of demand values is demonstrated and compared to safety metrics applying tactical deconfliction only, and to a baseline without DCB or tactical deconfliction. In addition, we also show the trade-off between ground delay and safety metrics while implementing various levels of DCB.

Such services, for hundreds to thousands of simultaneous UAM operations in constrained airspace, can only be realized with automated systems. In this study, we propose methods for generating pre-departure conflict-free four-dimensional (4D) flight trajectories, which can be further developed into an automated flight planning tool for PSU. We propose a semi-structured airspace design for future UAM, i.e., a layered airspace topology with direct routes between vertiports, avoiding physical obstacles such as buildings, obstructions, and restricted airspace using the visibility graph method. Based on the proposed airspace design, deconfliction strategies, e.g., flight level assignment and departure delay, are applied to obtain pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories of UAM operations by solving a mixed-integer programming model, with the objective function minimizing the operating cost of UAM operations. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impacts of three key cost parameters (electricity price, crew hourly rate, and maintenance hourly rate).

Two objective functions, i.e., minimum flight time and minimum control cost, are considered in the problem formulation.

Furthermore, considering the short travel time of the UAM, smart and safe decision-making will be challenging, particularly in off-nominal situations that force the aircraft to divert to an alternate destination instead of landing at the initially planned destination. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes automated pre-flight and in-flight contingency planning systems to assist in both normal and irregular UAM operations. A planner in the pre-flight planning system optimizes an aerial trajectory between the scheduled origin and destination, avoiding restricted high-level structures and estimating energy levels. In the contingency planning system, an in-flight replanner produces several optimal trajectories from where the diversion is declared to each alternate destination candidate. A diversion decision-making tool then scores a list of candidates and selects the best site for diversion.

To adequately understand the value proposition of UAM for metropolitan areas, the authors develop a holistic multi-modal toolchain, SimUAM, to model and simulate UAM and its impacts on travel behavior. This toolchain has several components: (1) Microsimulation Analysis for Network Traffic Assignment (MANTA): A fast, high-fidelity regional-scale traffic microsimulator, (2) VertiSim: A granular, discrete-event vertiport and pedestrian simulator, (3) Flexible Engine for Fast-time Evaluation of Flight Environments (Fe3 ): A high-fidelity, trajectory-based aerial microsimulation.

While most common solutions for merging control of ground transportation is First In First Out, air transportation vehicles are usually coordinated by an air traffic controller (ATC). ATC communicates with pilots via radio to direct the aircraft and resolve the conflict during the flight. Highly increasing demand in drone delivery and air mobility will increase air density, particularly in urban areas, which requires highly automated ATC systems. To meet the increasing demand in air transportation, a high standard autonomous support system is needed. With that growing demand and to keep airspace safe and efficient, we need an autonomous air traffic controller. In this study, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to handle high-density urban air mobility (UAM) operations by providing effective guidance to electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles to avoid conflicts, mitigate traffic congestion, and reduce travel time at merging points. The goal of our MARL approach is to reduce the time while ensuring safe separation at the environed urban air merging points by providing the speed advisories for each eVTOL vehicle to merge into the same air corridor. The proposed model is trained and evaluated using BlueSky, an open-source ATC simulation environment. Simulation results of thousands of aircraft using real-world data show that MARL is very promising to enable safe and efficient UAM operations at merging points. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.",

Lyu and Ayton’s airfoil serrated trailing-edge noise model is extended for the finite span length, the correct acoustic attenuation rate of trailing-edge noise, the modified spanwise wavenumber, and the scattering factor in Roger and Moreau’s trailing-edge noise model. This new theoretical model is implemented in the rotorcraft broadband noise tool, UCD-QuietFly. The validations show good agreements with experimental data for serrated trailing-edge noise of a wing section, a hovering rotor, and a forward-flight rotor. Next, the effects of serration parameters on rotor broadband noise are studied. For optimal and realistic rotor broadband noise reduction, the desirable design of a serrated-blade rotor has the serration height to wavelength ratio of 2 and the radial range of serrations from 50% blade span to the tip. It is also found that the sine-wave, chopped peak, or saw-tooth serration shapes reduce noise most among various shapes that are considered. Finally, noise reduction with serrations is applied to two urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft.

This paper investigates the effect of rotor speed control allocation of multicopters on handling qualities. Typically, multicopter aircraft are trimmed with equal speed on each rotor. The force generated by each rotor can be modeled, where thrust and torque of the rotor are related to the square of the rotor speed. The dynamic equations indicate that trimming pairs of motors at higher speeds results in an increase of control effectiveness in the associated axis, improving bandwidth and disturbance rejection. A tradeoff occurs where power usage is no longer minimal at trim, but handling qualities are improved in that control axis. A blade element model for multicopter, RMAC, was used to simulate how this off-nominal control allocation would affect the dynamics of a multicopter. System identification flight tests were used to validate the trends seen in RMAC. Control systems were optimized to provide improved disturbance rejection bandwidth in the axis associated with increased rotor speed. Unmanned mission task elements were performed in flight test, showing improved tracking in the lateral axis by using off-nominal mixing to increase trim speed on the rolling motors. The method was also investigated on a full-sale UAM hexacopter, which showed similar trends, but only small changes in the dynamics were achievable because of significantly smaller power margin as compared to the small scale hexacopter.

Nominal flight controllers are tuned for each aircraft to meet HQ specifications, where the controllers will reject disturbances to the aircraft groundspeed, attempting to maintain zero groundspeed. Froude-scaling is performed to scale the handling qualities specifications of the smaller aircraft, utilizing the additional agility. The nominal and scaled controllers are then compared in rejecting disturbance due to the turbulent headwind. Non-linear dynamic simulations are performed to evaluate the rigid body response of each aircraft, finding that scaling the flight controllers (on aircraft less than 1200 lb) reduces the pitch and roll attitude response so that all aicraft have similar peak-to-peak values. Following scaling, the peak-to-peak roll and pitch attitudes for all four aircraft are within 0.5° and 0.4° of each other, respectively. The improvement in disturbance rejection capabilities from scaling comes at the cost of 24% increase in the RMS current, and 2% additional current margin for the 50 lb aircraft (which is the largest increase).

The bare-airframe dynamics were first considered at three different hover trim points, where power consumption is increased to improve authority. The control and stability derivatives were examined at each trim point and an increase in base RPM caused increased authority for pitch inputs (and decreased authority for RPM inputs) in thrust-dominated axes. Explicit model following control laws wre then optimized using CONDUIT® to meet ADS-33E-PRF handling qualities specifications. Design margin optimization was then performed on each axis. Heave and yaw responses of the linearized system were examined for the three trim points with either RPM or pitch control. It was found that pitch-control outperformed RPM-control in heave, while the opposite was true for yaw. Hybrid control mixing was considered using a complementary filter, so that it uses pitch actuators for short-term responses, and RPM for trim. Effects of changes in motor time constant and complementary filter cutoff frequency were examined. The benefits of hybrid control were demonstrated through simulations that involved transition between trim points. Hybrid control required lower maximum power during thrust-driven maneuvers by allowing the aircraft to accelerate using pitch actuators, and recovers the original stall margin by using the rotor speed to re-trim. For a drop-off of 176 lbs of payload, hybrid control provided 5.0% lower trim power than pitch control with the reduced weight. Hybrid control also allowed a 3.9% reduction in power compared to pitch control at a flight speed of 30 kts. Copyright © 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved",

To deal with these challenges, in this paper we combine the concept of geofence and chance constraints to obtain chance-constrained geofences under data-driven uncertainties, which can guarantee that the probability of potential conflicts between eVTOL aircraft is bounded given a general empirical distribution. To evaluate the chance-constrained geofences in an online fashion, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is adopted and customized to model data-driven uncertainties. Comprehensive numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the online evaluation of chance-constrained geofence through the algorithm of FFT-based KDE. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The importance of this study is based on the expected growth of UAM in larger cities across the globe and on the consequent effort to decrease the noise emitted by this type of aircraft. Provided that rotors constitute a major part of the noise produced by this aviation segment, given the fact that the aircraft are intended to be fully electric, the design of these components is of paramount importance for noise minimization. Herein, the focus is on small rotors given the availability of experimental data to compare the numerical results. For the simulation accomplished within the optimization process, an open-source aerodynamic and aeroacoustic code (FLOWUnsteady, or FLight, Optimization, and Wind Unsteady) was integrated within an optimization module created specifically for the current work. These tools are based on the Formulation 1A of Farassat (PSU-WOPWOP) and the Brooks-Pope-Marcolini airfoil noise model (FLOWNoise), being utilized for the prediction of the tonal and atonal noise, respectively. The simulation code is applied to predict rotor noise which is posteriorly reduced by the means of a gradient-free optimization algorithm, leading to the proposed optimal rotor design, with a reduction of 16,21% of the Energy Averaged Overall Sound Pressure Level (EAOSPL) having been achieved. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The analysis approach for this paper fits between lower order tools such as lifting line or blade element theory and detailed volumetric flow solvers such as numerical solutions to the Navier Stokes Equations. The vorticity-based solver used for the work presented in this paper can capture detailed propeller blade geometries and propellers interacting with objects in the surrounding flow field including other propellers. Yet, computational times for this solver are sufficiently efficient and reliable for use in Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization applications. The numerical flow solver is validated for a set of coaxial propellers in a static free stream over a range of operating speeds for both propellers. The propeller model presented in this paper is designed for small UAV/UAM vehicles. The geometry to model this coaxial setup comes from a three-dimensional scan of the physical propeller. The results from the numerical solver are compared to wind tunnel test results for the coaxial propeller at rotational speeds and spacing between rotors assessed to be of interest to the UAV/UAM aircraft genre. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

They outline the UAM operational framework, the role of stakeholders, infrastructures, and the level of automation. A more mature states of operations begin at UML-5, where autonomous networks are highly integrated into ground-based remote piloting operations.

This fleet of vehicles will enable examination of the sensitivity of UAM vehicle designs to technology assumptions, identify key research and development needs for UAM aircraft, and provide the UAM community with reference vehicles that are publicly available and based upon known assumptions. To date, five six-passenger UAM reference vehicles have been published: a single-main-rotor helicopter, a side-by-side helicopter, a quadrotor, a lift-plus-cruise, and a tiltwing. To increase the breadth of vehicle technologies encapsulated in the fleet of NASA UAM reference vehicles, this paper establishes a tiltduct vehicle as an addition to the fleet. The fleet will continue to evolve as future analyses and trade studies are performed. The tiltduct UAM reference vehicle has six tilting ducted proprotors. This paper describes the initial configuration downselection; discusses ducted proprotor design rules of thumb as they applied to the conceptual design of the reference vehicle; describes the vehicle sizing, trade studies, and tuning of models performed; and finally, compares the resulting tiltduct vehicle against the other six-passenger NASA UAM reference vehicles. The high-level analyses performed for this study did not indicate significant differences in performance between the tiltduct and tiltwing reference vehicles, and so vehicle performance alone may not be a key driver in the selection of a tiltduct vehicle over a tiltwing vehicle. However, if ducts are found to have significant acoustical benefits, then acoustical priorities may provide a compelling reason to incorporate ducted proprotors. One significant limitation of the design presented in this paper is that the ducted proprotor performance was tuned based upon performance characteristics observed during historical tests with disk loadings (defined as thrust divided by proprotor disk area) of 125-250 lb/ft2. The tiltduct vehicle designed in this study has a disk loading of 30 lb/ft2, to be more representative of UAM vehicles; further studies to understand performance of ducted proprotors at representative disk loadings are warranted.

The majority of these concepts sport Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities taking advantage of progress made in the electric power delivery and storage systems. Acoustically the vertical takeoff and landing operations vary significantly to conventional fixed wing aircraft as drastic changes in the dominating noise sources, the air vehicle speed, trajectory, power settings and observer distances occur. This paper initiates the study of generating noise exposure contour maps for eVTOL aircraft, their unique operations and importantly the transition between vertical and horizontal flight. The method involves the generation of three-dimensional noise exposure surfaces surrounding the flightpath. The flightpath itself is deconstructed into fundamental operations such as hover, vertical climb/decent and flyover, allowing data in the format of Noise-Power-Distance curves to provide inputs for the various power settings. The aircraft is modeled as a lumped noise source whose directivity may rotate independently of the motion of the aircraft.

Motor specific power is limited by the temperature limits of stator winding insulation and the motor cooling system's ability to extract heat from the motor windings. The temperature limits of the stator winding are set by both thermal-chemical aging and thermo-mechanical stresses. In-slot cooling is known to be able to both more effectively reduce the max hotspot temperature in a winding and the thermo-mechanical stress in a winding at a given hotspot temperature relative to external cooling jackets. In this paper, a combined electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical optimization of in-slot cooled motors for UAM applications is completed. Initial thermal and mechanical studies of in-slot cooling topologies with a reference design were used to down select an in-slot cooled topology for optimization. Optimizations were carried out for both the in-slot cooled topology and a traditional externally cooled motor. Results show that the in-slot cooling topology can achieve a smaller mass than a traditional water jacket cooled design, but at the cost of lower efficiency due to larger required stator thicknesses and correspondingly larger stator iron loss. © 2022 IEEE.",

Also, an adaptive law is designed to estimate the upper boundary parameters of the UAM system uncertainties and disturbances, wherein the restrictive constant boundary assumptions and the prior information of the upper bound are not required in the controller design. Furthermore, to enable safe manipulation in a realistic situation, an end-effector trajectory generation method is presented satisfying the joint angle limitation. For the validation of the proposed method, the simulation results of numerical simulation comparisons are shown. Moreover, experimental scenarios including stable flight and simulated co-work with humans in complex environments are designed to verify the proposed method. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article is motivated by the problem of aerial manipulation under unknown disturbances, which may be caused by the wide movement of the manipulator and the sudden loading or unloading of an object.

In this article, the proposed controller with an adaptive law is designed to estimate the upper boundary parameters of the overall disturbances and ensure the predefined performance, so that the prior information of the upper bound of disturbances is not required. The performance of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated via numerical simulation comparisons and experiments, including stale flight and simulated co-work with humans in a complex environment.

The results show that trust positively influences the intention to use UAM, and safety perception contributes the most to UAM’s trustworthiness. In addition, transport service quality factors (i.e., time-saving, availability, flight comfort, and perceived cost) significantly explained the perceived usefulness and/or ease of use.

While fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft regularly operate over populated areas, the envisioned orders-of-magnitude increase in air traffic increases the risk to those on the ground and in the air. The risk calculus is also altered by the novel designs of some eVTOL aircraft. Many designs have neither significant autorotation nor low-speed-gliding capability to land safely in the event of catastrophic power failure. Ballistic parachute systems (ballistic recovery systems), such as those found in increasing use on general aviation aircraft and small UAS (drones) provide some risk mitigation, but provide no control over the landing location; the aircraft will land wherever the wind blows it. Aviation safety experts have noted that while ballistic recovery systems improve safety and should be included on all UAM aircraft, there are still hazards from a vehicle descending uncontrolled under a parachute. This paper covers the analysis and design of a guided emergency recovery system, which uses bleed-air control and a gliding steerable parachute. The analysis shows that due to the use of a parachute which provides lift, rather than a pure drag device, and the use of lightweight bleed-air control, the overall weight of a guided recovery system can be lower than an equivalent ballistic recovery system. A key feature for an effective guided recovery system is selection of its landing point. The development of a massively parallel probabilistic evaluation method for selecting landing points which provide the best likelihood of avoiding hazards is shown with examples. Simulations of EGRES in New York City Urban Air Mobility, UAS interstate highway inspection, and UAS nuclear power plant inspection scenarios showed that EGRES increased the likelihood of landing in an acceptable area by 2.3, 1.8, and 2.9 times respectively, compared with a ballistic parachute recovery system.

To accommodate the increased demand, NASA Glenn Research Center is investigating artificial intelligence approaches that could dynamically allocate spectrum; however, these solutions are driven by communication and aviation data items, many of which are not directly available. One such cornerstone data item is communication demand, parameterizing the needs within a sector in terms that may directly inform spectrum allocation, such as channel access duration, bandwidth, and modulation type. This paper considers the complexity of predicting communication demand as a function of NAS behaviors. Unlike prior prediction work in communications, this research must consider how the NAS may be impacted by external factors - such as convective weather and closures - rather than estimating demand from time-series forecasting alone. Much of this research considers a federated learning design to predict communication events in terms of the type of event occurring (sector coordination, conflict resolution, etc). To do so, an investigation of products from Sherlock Data Warehouse is conducted, identifying the trends, sufficiency, and correlations of each product to identified events. Additionally, a preliminary discussion for inferring associations between these event types and their communication parameters (duration, bandwidth, modulation) is presented. By utilizing federated learning, imbalances in the types of events and data present throughout the NAS can inform local models without impairing global training. Furthermore, the two-stage approach proposed allows for robust and speculative communication modelling, as communication techniques continue to evolve. As a result, this model enables a generalized approach to understanding NAS communications which is able to inform long-term changes to aviation spectrum management. © 2022 IEEE.",

This distressing situation creates opportunities for automobile and aircraft makers to develop state-of-the-art urban air mobility (UAM) solutions. The electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles seem to represent the future of urban mobility. Commercialized air taxis have the potential to completely disrupt the urban transportation system and relieve the urban streets from congestion. The case discusses the factors facilitating a speedy drift towards adopting air taxis and the recent developments in the UAM industry. To explore the air taxi market opportunities and business feasibility, the case examines the UAM ecosystem, the related cost and technology components, the industry's latest competitive landscape, and anticipated barriers to the successful implementation of the air taxi business.

Adolescent UAM in the United States (U.S.) are relatively understudied, especially regarding their resilience and emotional well-being after resettlement. Small school-based studies have documented the mental health status of UAM who resettled reuniting with their parents. However, many do not resettle with parents and less is known about the degree to which post-resettlement household composition impacts resilience and emotional well-being. Methods: Our goal was to examine how migration characteristics, supports, resilience, and emotional well-being vary by UAM resettlement household composition (reunification with parents, reunification with a non-parental family member, or living in a household not containing any family members). Using a mixed-methods (quantitative-qualitative) cross-sectional approach, we assessed 46 Latin American adolescent UAM to the U.S. who resettled into these three household types. Results: Youth experienced support differently by household type, influencing their strategies for adapting and coping post-resettlement, impacting their resilience (Kruskal Wallis-H 4.8; p<0.09) and emotional well-being (Kruskal Wallis 5.3; p<0.07). Youth living in households without relatives (n = 9) had lower resilience (Fisher's exact test p<0.002) and positive affect (Fisher's exact test p<0.003) and needed to expend greater efforts to mobilize social supports than youth living with parents (n = 22) or with non-parental family members (n = 15). Conclusion: The needs and coping abilities of UAM migrants vary with the composition of their immediate receiving environment, their post-resettlement household. Understanding differences associated with these household characteristics can guide interventions to maximize emotional health and resilience. © 2022","Adolescent migrants; Emotional health; Latino youth; Resettlement household composition; Resilience; Unaccompanied youth"

First, to take into account the dynamic characteristics of the UAM, a dynamic model of the UAM with state-dependent uncertainties and external disturbances is introduced. Then, note that a priori bounded uncertainty may impose a priori constraint on the system state before obtaining closed-loop stability. To remove this assumption, an ASMDO with a nested adaptive structure is introduced to effectively estimate and compensate the external disturbances and state-dependent uncertainties in finite time without the information of the upper bound of the uncertainties and disturbances and their derivatives. Furthermore, based on the proposed ASMDO, the finite-time control scheme with the prescribed performance is presented to ensure finite-time convergence and implement the specified transient and steady-state performance. The Lyapunov tools are utilized to analyze the stability of the proposed controller. Finally, the correctness and performance of the proposed controller are illustrated through numerical simulation comparisons and outdoor experimental comparisons.

The edgewise flight conditions included four tip Mach numbers, three freestream velocities, and two disk incidence angles representing realistic flight conditions for an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle. Forces were measured with a 6-axis load cell and far-field noise was measured with 1/4 in free-field microphones at 175 locations around the rotor. The tonal and broadband noise contributions were separated and analyzed in both the frequency and time domains. The mean thrust coefficient and torque coefficient were found to be proportional to the advance ratio squared. The sound pressure level (SPL) at the blade pass frequency (BPF) and the overall SPL (OASPL) increased for both increasing tip Mach number and increasing freestream velocity. The directivity of the noise displayed a dependency on advance ratio with a peak SPL below the retreating side. This mimics the unsteady loading noise directivity for a low tip speed rotor in edgewise flight. The broadband noise had a dipole directivity with a minimum in the rotor plane. The low/mid frequency broadband noise below 30 times the BPF had time signatures indicative of blade wake interaction noise, while the high frequency noise above 30 times the BPF had time signatures and directivities indicative of trailing edge noise.

In this paper, we consider Denial-of-Service (DoS) cyberattacks and their effects on UAM traffic synchronization and collision avoidance for aerial vehicles within the modeled UAM flight corridor. Network connectivity is essential for the system of UAM vehicles to perform tasks such as distributed optimal control, optimal consensus, or distributed optimization problems, in a collaborative manner.

However, they also assume circumstances in which the xTM vehicles would need to operate in conventional ATC-managed airspace, both during nominal and off-nominal scenarios. Due to the vast differences in the xTM vehicle performances and missions, there is a concern that ATC may have difficulty in safely managing the xTM traffic and providing appropriate services to all vehicles, unless a consistent set of roles, procedures, and data exchange requirements are defined across the diverse set of xTM vehicle operations. In this paper, we describe a set of use cases that have been identified in UTM, AAM/UAM, and ETM operations that are related to ATC interactions, and we propose to categorize these use cases across xTM domains based on common trigger events. Organizing the use cases from the perspective of ATC roles per each trigger event is expected to provide the first step in discovering common procedures and data requirements across xTM domains that could help ease the controllers’ cognitive task load and allow them to manage these interactions more safely. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

One of the project goals in HorizonUAM is the development of a system concept for an air taxi. This includes research on safe and certifiable onboard systems. The aim of this article is to present results and findings with emphasis on electric powertrain architectures in the multirotor air taxi design. A preliminary design methodology was developed therefor, which enables the examination of full-electric, turbo-electric and hybrid-electric powertrains. This methodology was used in a design study to investigate the influence of different powertrain architectures on the multirotor design. Different evaluation parameters, parameter sweeps and technology exploration of batteries and fuel cell systems were applied to analyze and evaluate their impact on the UAM vehicle design. The main design drivers are the mass of the energy sources and the overall powertrain efficiency, which have a direct impact on the evaluation parameters like power and energy efficiency, maximum take-off mass, and payload fraction. The study showed that different powertrain architectures could lead to opposite vehicle design criteria. Therefore, a clear solution for an advantageous powertrain architecture could not be found. Hybrid-electric solutions, e.g. fuel cell and battery systems or parallel hybrid-electric systems, offer the possibility of increasing efficiency in different flight phases through suitable power management while increasing system complexity. The disadvantage of a high battery mass of a full-electric solution could thus be at least partially reduced. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.",

The increasing demand in drone delivery and air mobility will increase air density, which requires highly automated air traffic control systems. To meet the growing demand in air transportation, a high standard autonomous support system is needed. In particular, we need an autonomous air traffic controller to keep the airspace safe and efficient. In this study, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach to handle high-density UAM operations by providing effective guidance to electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles to avoid traffic congestion and reduce travel time. The goal of our MARL approach is to reduce the time at the environed urban air intersections by providing the speed advisories to each approaching vehicle for safe separation at the intersection. The proposed model is trained and evaluated in BlueSky, an open-source air traffic control simulation environment. The results of our simulations with real-world data from thousands of aircraft show that using MARL for the separation problem at the intersection is very promising for solving the problem of en-route air traffic control. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These vehicles will operate at lower altitudes, in more dense environments, and with limited recovery abilities. Therefore, emergency landing scenarios must be considered broadly to understand the risks in some situations of flight failures. This work provides a preflight planning tool to assist these vehicles when emergency landing is required in crowded environments by fusing geographic data about the population, geometric data from lidar scans, and semantic data about land cover from aerial imagery. The Pix2Pix Conditional GAN is trained on Washington D.C. datasets to predict eight classifications at a 1m resolution. The information from this detection phase is transformed into a costmap, or riskmap, to use in planning the path to the safest landing locations. Multiple combinations of the cost layers are investigated in three test scenarios. The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm efficiently searches for an alternative path that minimizes risk during emergency landing. The tool is demonstrated through three scenarios in the D.C. area. The objective is that the tool allows for the safe operation of UAM and AAM vehicles through crowded regions by providing confidence to the local population and federal regulators. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Conventional NOMA-based aerial cellular networks consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an aerial user, in which secure control information for UAV is important. In recent days, the deployment of urban air mobility (UAM) has been actively discussed for a new aerial transport service in an urban area. Since UAM conveys passengers, both the traffic and the control information for passengers and a vehicle are important. Therefore, this paper considers a NOMA-based aerial cellular network with a UAM as an aerial user and a ground user as a terrestrial user. And we derive closed-form outage probabilities of the forward and reverse links of UAM, and the Monet-Carlo simulation verifies the results. Further, the condition to maintain the balance between the forward and the reverse links for the identical quality of service (QoS) is derived. Numerical results show that the outage probability of the forward link decreases with the increase of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, we noticed that the outage probability of the reverse link shows the error floor, which does not decrease with the received SNR and remains constant, caused by the interference from the ground user (GU). Also, it is shown that there is an average transmit power of UAM to conform the link balance regardless of strong or weak users. © 2022, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

A generic small-scale (1.35 m diameter) stiff (1st flap &gt; 2/Rev) coaxial rotor (D/4 spacing) was analyzed with two basic support arm geometries. This blade stiffness and rotor spacing is much larger than typically analyzed and can be representative of some eVTOL and UAM configurations. A study is first presented of an isolated coaxial rotor model for varied rotor blade flap stiffness to show the sensitivity of the fixed-frame rotor hub loads to the placement of these very stiff blade modes. Tuning the rotor blade stiffness reduced the maximum vibratory vertical hub force from 195 N to 125 N and the maximum vibratory hub moment from 175 N-m to 105 N-m. The tuned rotor was then coupled with a rectangular cross section support arm to show the effects that the support arm frequency placement has on vibratory loads. Tuning the support arm by changing the cross section to circular while keeping weight and length constant reduced the peak hub vibratory force from 650 N to 275 N and the peak arm tip vibratory moment from 325 N-m to 225 N-m.

An integral part of the MPC is a quadratic programming (QP) based optimizer solver, which can be accelerated by high-performance computing hardware and used to generate optimal control actions based on real-time model prediction. Machine learning algorithms can potentially be leveraged and incorporated in the controller to learn the model and parameters from real-time operation data, in addition to the known physical models. This MPC solver targets the problem of minimizing a predefined quadratic objective function, subject to equality and inequality constraints, and solve the optimization problem using the first-order optimality conditions. To find the solution online, the Jacobian matrix and gradient vector are updated iteratively, and then sent to a linear solver which is used to solve a set of linearized equation within each of the Newton’s iterations in the QP solver. Finally, after the linear solver finds a solution to the linear equation set, the QP solver’s solution vector will be updated. In the proposed MPC design, the controller aims to minimize the deviations from the desired trajectories, subject to the dynamic mission profiles, while managing the attitude of the vehicle. Preliminary simulation results from a pilot study show that the MPC control system operates well in tracking the desired trajectories and keeping the vehicle’s attitude angles within limits, under dynamic conditions. Further work will be ongoing to implement the control scheme on hardware and integrate the learning capability into the MPC controller. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

For these hovering configurations, the use of contra-rotating propellers allows both small dimensions together with sufficient thrust, hence good performance to size compromise. By that, the contra-rotating configuration becomes crucial concerning its performance potential for these vehicles. Unfortunately, performance of contra-rotating configuration is inferior compared to an equivalent single-rotating propeller. Moreover, its acoustic signature is worse, which contradicts the restrictive noise regulation. All of these requires meticulous design of the propulsion system, confronting both its performance and acoustic characteristics. This requires introduction of numerical optimization into the design process, which enables extracting the configuration full potential. Contra-rotating propeller configuration is non-trivial concerning optimal design. This is due to the complex nature of its aerodynamic analysis which implicates also on its noise characteristics. The current effort harnesses several models into unified design framework, which allows optimization of such configuration. The optimization environment is based on ESTECO’s modeFRONTIER which incorporates all analysis into the design framework. CFD-based analyses are doomed to fail, as part of optimization procedure, due to its very high computer resource requirement. Thus, aerodynamic analysis is based on simple and effective blade-element model, and acoustic prediction is based on standard discretization of the acoustic wave equation together with super-position of the forward and rear propeller contributions. Electric model and motor/propeller matching are based on electric relations which are implemented twice for each propeller in the contra-rotating configuration.

For advanced capability in preserving vortices, the distinguishing criterion was modified through vortex profile analysis, and low-Mach-number adjustment was performed by reconstructing the interpolated primitive variables. The proposed scheme was applied to wave propagation, shock discontinuity, double Mach reflection, propeller–wing interaction, and Second Higher-Harmonic Control Aeroacoustic Rotor Test problems. The computed results confirmed that eMLP-VC exhibits superior resolution, numerical stability, and computational time efficiency as compared to the multidimensional limiting process, eMLP, and weighted essentially nonoscillatory methods. © 2021 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Treating the neural network optimization process as a partially observable model selection problem, the regularity normalization constrains the implicit space by a normalization factor, the universal code length. We compute this universal code incrementally across neural network layers and demonstrate the flexibility to include data priors such as top-down attention and other oracle information. Empirically, our approach outperforms existing normalization methods in tackling limited, imbalanced and non-stationary input distribution in image classification, classic control, procedurally-generated reinforcement learning, generative modeling, handwriting generation and question answering tasks with various neural network architectures. Lastly, the unsupervised attention mechanisms is a useful probing tool for neural networks by tracking the dependency and critical learning stages across layers and recurrent time steps of deep networks. © 2021 by the authors.

A numerical simulation of the model shows that a transition from gasoline to electric cars yields major emission reductions, while leading to welfare losses due to tax-induced market distortions. Introducing UAM into a gasoline-car city leads to marginal overall welfare gains. Introducing UAM into a city with electric cars results in welfare losses.

Techniques of corpus-assisted discourse analysis were applied using UAM CorpusTool. The findings show that the main problem faced by high-proficiency learners was the overuse of connectives, while average- and low-proficiency learners tended to overuse and misuse them. The findings also reveal that inadequate knowledge of connectives, low awareness of genre, and poor understanding of writing requirements were possible reasons for these problems.

Since validation belongs to a category of decision-making processes, it should be prepared by dedicated scientific researches. In particular, the validation means a kind of characterization of the predictive capability maturity of given tools, libraries and calculational models. The compliance criteria might be expressed in terms of achievable accuracy or, inverse, in terms of somehow identified and quantified uncertainties. Despite the uncertainties, as such, might not be measured or compared with something measurable all the judgments should rely on reality, i.e., be supported by an evidence-based background. In practice it does require to eliminate subjective statements, if any, replacing them with something inferred from objective observations, including representative integral experiments. Unfortunately, in many fields like, among others, multi-physics simulations, we have not statistically sufficient number of high-fidelity and confident experiment-based benchmarks. In addition, because of technological and safety constraints, what is needed lies, largely, beyond the experimental domain. This is why, assessors have to rely on numerous, but partially representative experiments. These data could be treated using one or other Data Assimilation techniques to provide correction factors and uncertainties to single- and few-physics modules all having an evidence-based background. Then, coupling these pre-validated modules and their uncertainties, we could estimate uncertainties (and accuracies) in an application domain using one of wide range error propagation techniques. Thus, combining experiments-grounded and calibrated uncertainties, we are providing consistent, evidence-based background for validation.

These configurations feature electrical power systems and distributed propulsion architectures, both uncommon in current aircraft. As such, the design of eVTOL aircraft lies outside the bounds of current established frameworks and poses many challenges in the field of preliminary aircraft design. This paper presents a preliminary design methodology for open rotor eVTOL configurations with batteries as the power source. First, the propeller external dimensions are calculated, and then an optimised blade geometry for cruise condition is computed. Thereupon, the batteries and electric motors are sized. The design framework is then applied to an eVTOL aircraft with a design range of 400 km and a capacity of five occupants (four passengers and one pilot), focusing on the central-European market and aimed to be released in 2030. The final configuration is a battery-powered tandem-wing aircraft with 12 variable-pitch, variable-speed open rotors placed on the leading edges of the wings. These rotors rotate outboard-down and feature six blades. The power source comprises 24 solid-state lithium batteries with a nominal voltage of 500 V and an assumed energy density of 500 Wh/kg. The proposed design methodology offers the possibility of computing the necessary propeller geometry for numerical simulations in the early stages of the design, and of easily obtaining accurate estimates for the mass of the power system which can improve the overall mass estimates for the analysed configuration. © 2021 by the authors.

Preventing the conflict among urban aircraft is crucial to UAM traffic safety, which is a key in enabling large scale UAM operation. Pre-flight conflict-free path planning can provide a strategic layer in the maintenance of safety performance, thus becomes an important element in UAM. This paper aims at tackling conflict-free path planning problem for UAM operation with a consideration of four-dimensional airspace management. In the paper, we first introduce AirMatrix, previously developed by the team, and extend it as a four-dimensional airspace management concept. On the basis of AirMatrix, we formulate the shortest flight time path planning problem considering resolution of conflicts with both static and dynamic obstacles. A Conflict-Free A* (CFA*) algorithm is developed for planning four-dimensional paths based on first-come-first-served scheme. The algorithm contains a novel design of heuristic function as well as a conflict detection and resolution strategy. Numerical simulation was carried out using the building information in a typical urban area in Singapore. The results show that the algorithm can generate paths resolving a significant number of potential conflicts in airspace utilization, with acceptable computational time and flight delay.

In 2006, the LWR Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) benchmark was launched with an aim to investigate the uncertainty propagation in all modeling stages of the LWRs and guide uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methodology development. This article summarizes the benchmark activities for the standalone neutronics phase (Phase I), which includes three main exercises: Exercise I-1: “Cell Physics,” Exercise I-2: “Lattice Physics,” and Exercise I-3: “Core Physics.” A comparative analysis of the Phase I results is performed in this article for all the considered LWRs types: Three Mile Island – 1 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), Peach Bottom – 2 Boiling Water Reactor (BWR), Kozloduy – 6 Water - Water Energetic Reactor (VVER) and a Generation-III reactor. It was found, for all major exercises, that the predicted uncertainty of the system eigenvalue is highly dependent on the choice of the covariance libraries used in the UQ process and is less sensitive to the solution method, nuclear data library and UQ method. For all four reactor types, the observed relative standard deviation across all exercises is approximately 0.5% for the UO2 fuel. In the pin cell and lattice calculations with MOX fuel this uncertainty increases to 1%. The main reason is the larger Pu-239 nu-bar uncertainty compared to the U-235 nu-bar. The largest contributors to the eigenvalue uncertainties are the U-235 nu-bar and the U-238 capture in the UO2 fuel and the Pu-239 nu-bar in the MOX fuel. In the assembly lattice exercises, higher uncertainties are predicted for the fast group than the thermal group constants with differences up to one order of magnitude. This is attributed to the larger uncertainties of most cross-sections at high energies. The obtained correlation matrices share some common major trends but also exhibit strong differences in case by case comparisons indicating an impact of the selected neutronics modeling and nuclear data library. In the core exercises, the predicted relative standard deviation of the radial and axial power, for most of the cores, is below 10%. An exception is the radial power profile of the Generation-III core, when a mixture of UOX/MOX assemblies is considered. Finally, it is important to note that the bias in most of the studies is significant and up to the same order of the estimated uncertainty. This indicates a need for better quantification of the bias/variance through more code to code and code to experiments comparisons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Benchmark; LWR; Neutronics; Summary; Uncertainty analysis"

The design of hybrid-electric propulsion systems (HEPSs) for rotorcraft is seen as being able to contribute to those goals. This work aims to conduct a comprehensive design and tradeoff analysis of hybrid powerplants for rotorcraft, targeting enhanced payload-range capability and fuel economy. An integrated methodology for the design, performance assessment, and optimal implementation of HEPSs for conceptual rotorcraft has been developed. A multidisciplinary approach is devised comprising models for rotor aerodynamics, flight dynamics, HEPS performance, and weight estimation. All models are validated using experimental or flight test data. The methodology is deployed for the assessment of a hybrid-electric tilt-rotor, modeled after the NASA XV-15. This work targets to provide new insight into the preliminary design and sizing of optimally designed HEPSs for novel tilt-rotor aircraft. The paper demonstrates that at present, current battery energy densities (250 Wh/kg) severely limit the degree of hybridization if a fixed useful payload and range are to be achieved. However, it is also shown that if advancements in battery energy density to 500 Wh/kg are realized, a significant increase in the level of hybridization and hence reduction of fuel burned and carbon output relative to the conventional configuration can be attained.

Nevertheless, the current low battery energy density limits the application of these propulsive architectures to large transport aircraft. In the context of the general aviation category, full-electric aircraft for the so-called Urban Air Mobility scenario are gaining increasing interest. These air taxis, also called e-VTOL, are conceived to exploit vertical take-off and landing capabilities, to carry people from one point to another, typically within the same city. In this paper, a new conceptual design methodology for urban air vehicles is presented and applied to an innovative convertiplane, called TiltOne, based on a box-wing architecture coupled with tilt-wing mechanisms. Several TiltOne configurations have been designed according to the current regulations imposed by European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and sensitivity analyses have been carried out on the varying main design parameters, such as wing loading and propellers’ disk loading, as well as main top-level aircraft requirements. The results provide an overview for today’s operational capabilities of such aircraft and, in addition, depict possible scenarios for a near-future horizon, based on the assumption of increased performance levels for the electric powertrain components. In such scenario, two different concepts of operations are analysed and discussed: the first is based on a given design range, long enough to cover the urban distances; the second is conceived to exploit the capability of flying multiple shorter missions with a single battery charge. The designed TiltOne configurations derived from these different approaches are presented, highlighting their potential capabilities and possible drawbacks. © 2021 by the authors.

Alongside this effort, we conduct an in-depth review of articles related to demand modeling, operations, and integration with existing infrastructure. We use insights from the meta-analysis and comprehensive review to inform future UAM research directions.

In this study, virtual flights of the noise sources to mimic the drones and urban air mobilities are conducted to investigate the environmental impact by using the Gaussian beam tracing method implemented in an in-house solver Environmental Acoustic Ray Tracing Code, in which the dominant acoustic processes in outdoor applications are modelled. The solver also allows for modelling of sources with generic directivity patterns, which is beneficial for investigating the drone and urban air mobility noise produced by multiple rotors. Two examples of studying noise impact on building and realistic urban environment are conducted. The effects of the surface acoustic impedance, source type and flight path are investigated.

We present an approach for formally guaranteeing timely progress in a Two-Phase Acknowledge distributed knowledge propagation protocol by probabilistically modeling the delays using theories of the Multicopy Two-Hop Relay protocol and the M/M/1 queue system. The guarantee states a probabilistic upper bound to the time for progress as a function of the probabilities of the total transmission and processing delays being less than two given values.

A major asset for AT operations is the connection to existing airports enabling the access to multiple other transportation systems. This paper develops an analytical model for AT operations and their capacity impact on airports, exemplary for Hamburg airport. The model is developed, based on the results of a fast time simulation (FTS) considering multiple aspects, such as vehicle configuration and touchdown and lift-off areas (TLOF). Collectively, three integration methods were analysed, each of them impacting the conventional air traffic differently. The results show that an integration using the runway-system is not possible with five ATs per hour. Further methods allow an integration of up to 20 air taxis per hour. Additionally, an energy consumption analysis of the ATs is conducted. Finally, proposals are given for integrating ATs at an airport and further strategies to extend the analytical model. Through this work, a model to calculate and predict an AT’s influence on the airside capacity of an airport is designed.

Due to its novelty and as it has not yet been implemented, UAM research still faces uncertainties. In particular, there is a need to develop a roadmap for the early implementation of passenger air mobility, aiming to identify the most prominent challenges, opportunities, hazards, and risks, but also to highlight the most promising use cases, or on the contrary, the ones associated with the least benefits compared to the risks or complexity they entail. To answer the previous questions, and therefore address this research gap, this study used a two-round Delphi questionnaire, targeting various stakeholder groups (product owners, policymakers, researchers, consultants, investors), leading to a total of 51 experts, out of which 34 also participated in the second round. In the first round, the main challenges, opportunities, and hazards facing the implementation of passenger UAM were identified. Findings on challenges and opportunities that were dependent on use cases only (as opposed to being dependent on technology or external factors) were then fed back into the second round, which helped evaluate the use cases based both on their complexities, as well as the associated benefits. Accordingly, medical/emergency was identified as the best use case and intracity transport as the worst (in terms of complexity vs. benefits). Similarly, a risk analysis evaluated the potential hazards associated with the implementation of UAM and their impacts on the system viability. Community backlash was found to be the most hazardous one, while malicious passenger behavior and improperly designed infrastructure as the least. Findings from this study can help better understand stakeholders’ opinions, highlighting promising use cases, but also risks to be aware of, constituting therefore a roadmap for future implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, metropolitan regions are typically characterized by complex and dense terminal airspace structure that accommodates arrival and departure traffic from large metroplex airports. Therefore, UAM operations are expected to be initially integrated into urban airspace without interfering with conventional operations and compromising current safety and efficiency levels. This paper presents a data-driven approach to identify and predict available urban airspace that is procedurally separated from conventional air traffic towards supporting UAM integration. We use historical aircraft tracking and meteorological data to learn the spatial distribution of air traffic in the terminal airspace and create a probabilistic traffic model to predict active traffic patterns and their spatial confidence regions given current operational conditions. We demonstrate the approach for the city of Sao Paulo and its closest commercial airport, Congonhas (CGH), in Brazil. The results show that leveraging the traffic flow dynamics to allocate the urban airspace dynamically is beneficial to increase UAM accessibility by more than 5% from 3000 ft. Moreover, airspace availability is found to be highly sensitive to the applied separation requirements, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to progressively make such requirements less stringent. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air Traffic Management; Dynamic airspace management; Gaussian Mixture Model; Predictive modeling; Trajectory clustering; Urban Air Mobility"

Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a part of AAM, focused on transport passengers in low-altitude urban airspace, has attracted extensive attention among industry, government, academia, and the public. Compared to existing commercial flights, AAM operations are expected to be at higher density; thus, an AAM system needs to be scalable, safe, and autonomous. Third-party service providers are recommended for offering air traffic management and information sharing services given the anticipated high density of UAM operations. To this end, we propose an Automated Flight Planning System (AFPS) that could be employed by such service providers. In the AFPS, a Low-Altitude Airspace Management System (LAMS) is proposed to automatically generate a route network with the capability of avoiding obstacles and obstructions in low-altitude airspace. The main components of this tool are the generation of a 3D map with LiDAR data, construction of a nodal network based on the map by using the visibility graph method, and initiation of 3D shortest paths. Given the requests of flight operations, i.e., origin, destination, departure time, the Low-Altitude Traffic Management System (LTMS) will design pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories and provide flexibilities of en-route maneuvering by taking system cost and equity among operators into consideration. In this study, a flight-level assignment strategy is proposed to solve the trajectory deconfliction problem in LTMS. In addition, a Nash Social Welfare Program (NSWP) is introduced to maintain fairness among different operators if the service is provided to multiple operators of UAM. A case study of the Tampa Bay area in Florida is used to demonstrate the operability of the proposed AFPS, and animations are built to visualize the optimized conflict-free operations of UAM in the study area. © 2021 The Authors","Aerodrome; Air traffic management; Conflict-free 4D trajectory planning; Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL); Provider of service for UAM (PSU)"

These vehicles offer urban air mobility (UAM) services using the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology. This research is the first to present a hybrid simulation goal programming (HSGP) approach to dispatch vehicles in a centralized air taxi network. After each customer drop-off, the model makes real-time decisions on (i) whether the air taxi must become idle or pick up customers, and (ii) the station to which the air taxi should be dispatched (if the air taxi is operational). The feasibility of the HSGP approach is tested using potential air taxi demands in New York City (NYC) provided by a prior study. The results of the experimentation suggest that the minimum number of air taxis required for efficient operation in NYC is 84, functioning with an average utilization rate of 66%. In addition, the impacts of commuter's “willingness to fly” rate, percentage of demand fulfillment, on-road travel limit, maximum customer wait time, and arrival distribution on the optimal number of air taxis, utilization rate, number of customers served, and cost incurred per customer are examined. Analyses show that the “willingness to fly” rate appears to have a linear influence on the number of air taxis and the efficiency, while on-road travel distance has an exponential impact on the performance measures.

It’s a dilemma whether to treat adolescent ameloblastoma patients with initial radical treatment, extensive surgery or conservative procedures. The radical treatment could result in deformity and dysfunction of the jaw that are bound to influence both the physical and psychological development of the patient in later life. And the surgical excision of the surrounding tissues and the extraction of affected teeth could result in the defects in the dentition function and aesthetics, which make the reconstruction of the occlusion remains challenging. We describe the successful interdisciplinary orthodontic treatment combined with decompression of a patient with ameloblastoma. A 10-year-old female with a UAM in the mandible and the right mandibular second premolar impacted was recruited. The patient received the comprehensive orthodontic treatment combined with the decompression of the cystic lesions. Panoramic radiographs indicated that the dentoalveolar bone of the UAM region was well healed. The impacted right mandibular second premolar erupted eventfully, with no evidence of recurrence in 34 months. The malocclusion was corrected and appeared stable after the orthodontic treatment. Our findings in this case report suggest that the combination of conservative therapy and orthodontic treatment is one of an effective management option to reconstruct the occlusion of an adolescent patient with a UAM in the mandible.

FADS takes into account federal UAS safety requirements, UAM challenge scenarios, contingency events, as well as stakeholder-specific operational requirements. FADS formalizes these requirements, through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) representations, and a trajectory planning optimization for multi-rotor UAS fleets guarantees robust and continuous-time satisfaction of the requirements and mission objectives. The intuitive FADS user interface makes it easy to plan missions in a variety of environments; we demonstrate this through several rural and urban environment-based case studies. FADS holistically integrates high-level stakeholder objectives with low-level trajectory planning; combined with a user-friendly interface, FADS reduces the complexity of stakeholder coordination within the UAM context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Robust Trajectory Lanning; Signal Temporal Logic; Unmanned Aerial Systems; Urban Air Mobility"

Emerging innovations in electrification, automation, and other technologies are enabling new opportunities for on-demand air mobility, business models, and aircraft design. Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) 'flying car' concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on sustainability, social and economic impacts, airspace integration, and other topics. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Advanced air mobility (AAM); automation; electrification; flying cars; helicopters; on-demand air mobility; rural air mobility; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); unmanned aircraft (UA); unmanned aircraft systems (UAS); urban air mobility (UAM); vertical take-off and land (VTOL)"

To justify public investment, UAM must serve urban mobility by carrying a significant portion of urban traffic. We develop a traffic demand analysis method to estimate the maximum number of people that can benefit from UAM, for a given use case, in a metropolitan region. We apply our method to about three hundred thousand cross-bay commute trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. We estimate the commuter demand shift to UAM under two criteria of flexibility to travel time savings and three criteria of vertiport transfer times. Our results indicate that even for commuters with high value of time, and long transfer times at vertiports, almost forty-five percent of demand would benefit from UAM when the roads are highly congested. Even when the roads are mostly free, about three percent of the demand can benefit from UAM with the right combination of commuter flexibility and transfer times. Finally, our method also produces the number, location and distribution of demand over vertiports that can support value proposition, policy-making and technology research for UAM. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","traffic demand analysis; unmanned aircraft systems; Urban air mobility; vertiports"

The monitoring process receives high data-rate sensor values from eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The assessment process takes these values and performs a classification that was developed using machine learning algorithms. The mitigation process invokes a collaboration protocol called DFACCto which, based on context, performs vehicle operations that the operator would otherwise routinely execute.

To achieve a flawless machined surface at reasonable cutting tool life/cost, an optimum combination of cutting tool material and geometry is the key. The cutting tool angles are of importance as these dictate the cutting mechanism as well as the cutting edge robustness and the introduction of vibration to the machining process opens up new horizons of improvement and stirs further research questions. This article investigates the effect of tools with different geometry possessing different rake angles when used in ultrasonic-assisted edge trimming operation dealing with multidirectional CFRP laminates. A full-factorial experimental design was adopted to analyze the effect of process parameters typically cutting speed, feed rate, rake angle, amplitude, and their interactions. Machining performance indicators were captured which were the cutting forces, tool wear, chip temperature, and surface roughness. The results showed that UAM mode contributed to an increase in the cutting forces, tool wear, and chip temperature compared to the conventional mode. On the other hand, UAM mode improved the quality of the machined surface. Additionally, the ultrasonic mode enhanced the material removal mechanism using a tool with a negative rake angle. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","CFRP; Edge trimming; Multidirectional; Rake angle; Ultrasonic"

This article discusses the results of a demand analysis examining the market potential of two potential AAM passenger markets-airport shuttles and air taxis. The airport shuttle market envisions AAM passenger service to, from, or between airports along fixed routes. The air taxi market envisions a more mature and scaled service that provides on-demand point-to-point passenger services throughout urban areas. Using a multi-method approach consisting of AAM travel demand modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and constraint analysis, this study estimates that the air taxi and airport shuttle markets could capture a 0.5% mode share. The analysis concludes that AAM could replace non-discretionary trips greater than 45 min; however, demand for discretionary trips would be limited by consumer willingness to pay.

UAM is a concept mode of transportation that is designed to bypass ground congestion for time-sensitive, price-inelastic travelers using autonomous, electric aircraft with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. This study focuses specifically on commuting trips, which are frequent and considered relatively more time-sensitive than other types of personal trips. The UAM mode's feasibility is studied using sensitivity analysis of UAM demand to cost per passenger mile and the number of vertiports placed in the region. This study also explores the spatial distribution of UAM demand in Northern California, which further helps in identifying the major commuter trip-attraction and trip-production zones for the UAM mode in the region. The results indicate that sufficient UAM demand for commuting trips can only be reached at optimistically low UAM offered fares. These fare levels could be challenging to obtain given the high real estate cost in Northern California's urban regions. Moreover, the reliability of the UAM mode must be comparable to the automobile mode; otherwise, it loses significant demand with increasing delays. The results also show that the commuting flows with promising UAM demand in Northern California are heavily one-directional, with San Francisco Financial District being a major attraction. Other types of trips should also be considered along with commuting trips to generate an economically viable system and reduce deadheading. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","On-demand mobility; Travel demand; Urban air mobility; Vertical takeoff and landing"

One of these new concepts is urban air mobility (UAM). It makes use of passenger drones for on-demand transport in urban settings, promising high travel speeds for those willing and able to pay. This research aims to answer the question how benefits from UAM will be distributed, taking into account the spatial dimension and the differential impacts on low- and high-skilled households. We develop a framework that can more generally be used to assess the welfare impacts resulting from the introduction of novel transport modes. The development of an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model building on the polycentric modelling tradition developed by Anas and co-authors allows for an analysis of mutually dependent effects on the land, labour and product markets, triggered by changes on the transport market. Allowing for an endogenous spatial structure through the introduction of agglomeration effects and an amenity-based approach, the framework investigates the relevance of the initial spatial structure for the impact of the introduction of UAM. Incorporating different skill levels of households allows to assess location choice and travel behaviour for households with different characteristics. A numerical simulation of the model shows that the different initial spatial structures impose comparable welfare changes. Variations in UAM features like marginal cost, prices, land demand for infrastructure, vertical travel speed and access and egress times have a (much) more decisive impact on modal choice and welfare effects than the initial urban structure. Simulations show that considering households of different skill levels brings additional insights, as welfare effects of UAM introduction strongly differ between groups and sometimes even go in opposing directions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agglomeration effects; Spatial equilibrium; Urban air mobility; Welfare effects"

UAM missions with complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements can be succinctly represented using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a behavioral specification language. However, planning and control of systems with STL specifications is computationally intensive, usually resulting in planning approaches that do not guarantee dynamical feasibility, or control approaches that cannot handle complex STL specifications. Here, we present an approach to co-design the planner and control such that a given STL specification (possibly over multiple UAV s) is satisfied with trajectories that are dynamically feasible and our controller can track them with a bounded tracking-error that the planner accounts for. The tracking controller is formulated for the non-linear dynamics of the individual UAVs, and the tracking error bound is computed for this controller when the trajectories satisfy some kinematic constraints. We also augment an existing multi-UAV STL-based trajectory generator in order to generate trajectories that satisfy such constraints. We show that this co-design allows for trajectories that satisfy a given STL specification, and are also dynamically feasible in the sense that they can be tracked with bounded error.

The crystallinity of the membranes is studied by X-Ray diffraction in the region of large angles 2θ from 2° to 40°, using a DRON-3 diffractometer with modern methods of the computer processing of experimental data. Comparative analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns reveal the coincidence of the diffraction angles for the working and air-dry samples of ultrafiltration membranes, while the membrane samples have three pronounced maxima located approximately in the angular range from 17.50° to 25.60°. The crystallinity for the air-dry samples is 68% for UAM-50 and 74% for UAM-100, and for the working samples, it is 32 and 41% for UAM-50 and UAM-100, respectively. Investigations of the surface of drainage layers of the UAM-50 and UAM-100 ultrafiltration membranes are carried out by scanning electron microscopy. The thickness of the active layer is 27 nm for the UAM-50 membrane and 15 nm for the UAM-100 membrane. Pores of different sizes are visible on the surface of the active layer of the membrane; the pore sizes range from 2.5 to 40 nm for UAM-50 and from 10 to 40 nm for UAM-100. Kinetic studies of the ultrafiltration membranes confirm that they have an asymmetric pore structure. Small pores in the membrane trap contaminant molecules, while large pores allow the permeate to pass quickly to a more open permeate carrier, that is, a purified solution. The water permeability of the working membrane increases with an increase in the transmembrane pressure due to an increase in the driving force of the process and rearrangement of the crystal structure (a decrease in the size of crystals in the working sample of the membrane) and a decrease in the crystallinity of the membranes. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","active layer; crystallinity; pores; ultrafiltration membrane; water permeability; X-ray diffractometry"

Though traditionally categorised by disease status in oncology (i.e. progression), several recent assessments have adopted values calculated according to the time that measures were recorded before death. We conducted a simulation study to understand the limitations of each approach, with a focus on mismatches between the way utilities are generated, and analysed. Methods: Survival times were simulated based on published literature, with permutations of three utility generation mechanisms (UGMs) and utility analysis methods (UAMs): (1) progression based, (2) time-to-death based, and (3) a ‘combination approach’. For each analysis quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated. Goodness of fit was assessed via percentage mean error (%ME) and mean absolute error (%MAE). Scenario analyses were performed varying individual parameters, with complex scenarios mimicking published studies. The statistical code is provided for transparency and to aid future work in the area. Results: %ME and %MAE were lowest when the correct analysis form was specified (i.e. UGM and UAM aligned). Underestimates were produced when a time-to-death element was present in the UGM but not included in the UAM, while the ‘combined’ UAM produced overestimates irrespective of the UGM. Scenario analysis demonstrated the importance of the volume of available data beyond the initial time period, for example follow-up. Conclusions: We show that the use of an incorrectly or over-specified UAM can result in substantial bias in the estimation of utilities.

One recurring element is the use of pre-defined airways or corridors, a natural way to create order, with proven success from the conventional, manned, Air Traffic Management (ATM). But, while ATM is evolving to 4D Trajectory-Based Operations, when we apply the ATM principles to very dense and potentially more complex operations such as AAM, we have to consider their limitations in such demanding new environment. The requirement of following circulation corridors most often increase flight distance and inevitably create bottlenecks, hence we explore the hypothesis of not using corridors, testing such option via a simple and scalable simulation model. Other motivations for comparing different forms of traffic coordination are redundancy and diversity, which have potential to increase system safety. Relying on a single method to maintain traffic separation of course would not be allowed in practice. However, the concepts that we have seen so far leave a gap between two very distinct and coexisting methods: one, cooperative and centered on a ground-based Provider of Services for UAM (PSU), and another which is mostly non-cooperative and independent, centered on the individual aircraft, commonly referred to as Detect-And-Avoid (DAA). This duality achieves a welcomed diversity, however there are several areas for improvement. In-between these opposite methods, this paper analyzes the performance of an airborne cooperative method to coordinate traffic which is capable of safely solving conflicts of multiple aircraft (more than two) and achieve higher efficiency than DAA alone, thus with potential for being an alternative or a live fallback for ground-based traffic coordination. © 2021 IEEE.",

The vertiports are expected to be placed on rooftops in Central Business Districts (CBD), limiting vertiports' size and suggesting high infrastructure costs. Therefore, vertiport capacity analysis is critical for an efficient UAM network as operations could be tailored for maximum efficiency. This analysis uses the vertiport designs developed for a previous study using current guidelines for heliports by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The minimum area of all designs was estimated for single and dual taxi-lanes configurations. From a preliminary geospatial analysis of San Francisco CBD, the rooftops' sizes are less likely to accommodate vertiports with more than three landing pads, even with tailored modifications.

UAM is expected to offer an alternative way of transporting passengers and goods in urban areas with significantly improved mobility by making use of low-altitude airspace. In addition to other essential elements, ground infrastructure of vertiports is needed to transition UAM from concept to operation. This study examines the network design of UAM on-demand service, with a particular focus on the use of integer programming and a solution algorithm to determine the optimal locations of vertiports, user allocation to vertiports, and vertiport access- and egress-mode choices while considering the interactions between vertiport locations and potential UAM travel demand. A case study based on simulated disaggregate travel demand data of the Tampa Bay area in Florida, USA was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Candidate vertiport locations were obtained by analyzing a three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system (GIS) map developed from lidar data of Florida and physical and regulation constraints of eVTOL operations at vertiports. Optimal locations of vertiports were determined to achieve the minimal total generalized cost; however, the modeling structure allows each user to select a better mode between ground transportation and UAM in terms of generalized cost. The outcomes of the case study reveal that although the percentage of trips that switched from ground mode to multimodal UAM was small, users choosing the UAM service benefited from significant time saving. In addition, the impact of different parameter settings on the demand for UAM service was explored from the supply side, and different pricing strategies were tested that might influence potential demand and revenue generation for UAM operators. The combined effects of the number of vertiports and pricing strategies were also analyzed. The findings from this study offer in-depth planning and managerial insights for municipal decision-makers and UAM operators.

UAM networks rely on an infrastructure of vertiports, which are closely tied to the ability of the UAM service to operate effectively. This research addresses identifying desirable locations for vertiports while taking into account vehicle limitations, desired operational strategies, and the possibility of passenger trips involving more than two vertiports. The vertiport selection problem is presented as a modified single-allocation p-hub median location problem that incorporates elements of subgraph isomorphism to create structured networks to allow for public transit operations. Because the problem is NP-hard, five heuristic algorithms are developed to find potential solutions with acceptable computation times. The methods are compared to the optimal solution in three different areas of the United States. The most effective of these methods are found to be within 10% of the optimal solution on average, and results indicate that they scale well to larger networks. General trends from the three case study regions examined are also briefly discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

Several methods have been developed to compute generalized sensitivity coefficients for nuclear data. One method is the GEneralized Adjoint Responses in Monte Carlo (GEAR-MC) method which can be used to analyze the sensitivity coefficients of reaction rate ratios. However, this method requires the generalized adjoint function to estimate the sensitivity coefficients. The generalized adjoint function can be calculated using a method like the iterated fission probability (IFP) method which has a huge memory requirement. In this paper, the superhistory-based GEAR-MC method is developed to reduce the huge memory requirement induced by calculating the generalized adjoint function. This newly developed superhistory-based GEAR-MC method is found to be accurately predict the sensitivities of the reaction rate ratios for the Godiva, Flattop and the UAM TMI PWR pin cell benchmark problems. The calculations also show that the memory usage of the superhistory-based GEAR-MC method is 98% less than for the traditional power iteration-based GEAR-MC method. In addition, it is shown that the superhistory-based GEAR-MC method will increase the runtime and this increase is not totally linearly proportional to the number of inner generations in each superhistory for all test cases. Moreover, the equivalence of GEAR-MC method and first-order differential operator method are also proved in this paper. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","GEAR-MC method; Generalized response function; Memory reduction; Sensitivity analysis; Superhistory"

The reliability of such critical systems is therefore key to ensure high safety standards in the low-altitude airspace. Diagnostic systems, which aim at identifying incipient faults, can mitigate unexpected failures or lower-than-expected reliability by performing early fault detection by monitoring the systems. A key element of fault diagnosis is fault detection and isolation (FDI), which complexity increases with the complexity of the system itself, namely the number of subsystems and components,interactions among sub-systems, and the number of sensors available. The proposed approach leverages combination of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) integrated with Bayesian networks, thus introducing dependability structures into a diagnostic framework to aid FDI. Faults and failure events from the FMEA are mapped within a Bayesian network, where network edges replicate the links embedded within FMEAs. The integrated framework enables the fault isolation process by identifying the probability of occurrence of specific faults or root causes given evidence observed through sensor signals. In this work, sub-systems of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) type vehicle like avionics, structures, power-train etc are taken into account to show the approach at the system level. This work integrates early design phase in the development of UAM type vehicles with diagnostic tools, which are often developed later in the product life-cycle, or retrofitted at a later time on systems.

UAM-100, UAM-150, and MGA-95 composite films have been studied using thermogravimetry in the temperature range from 30 to 300°C. A kinetic analysis of experimental data by the Freeman–Carroll method is carried out. It was found that hydrated water for all the studied semi-permeable films evaporates in the temperature range from ~95 to ~180°C. Comparison of the ratios of the amount of removed water in the film samples correlates with the geometric parameters of the pores. The values of the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor (E = 26.9 kJ/mol and ln(A ≈ 6.3 (min–1)) in the range 0.2 &lt; α &lt; 0.7 of the degree of dehydration indicate the same regularity in the distribution of water molecules in the polymolecular layer for all composite films. The high dehydration values, e.g., for a sample of a composite semipermeable film MGA-95 at the temperature of the maximum on the thermogravimetry curve (Tmax = 169.6°C) indicate that water molecules form hydrogen bonds both with ionogenic groups of cellulose acetate and with each other. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

Study design: This is a cross-sectional Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring (UAM) Survey of PWID. Methods: People who had ever injected psychoactive drugs were recruited to the UAM Survey by specialist drug/alcohol services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From June 2020, in addition to providing a dried blood spot sample and completing the UAM behavioural questionnaire, participants were asked to complete an enhanced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) questionnaire. Preliminary data are presented to the end of October and were compared with data from the 2019 UAM Survey, where possible. Results: Between June and October, 288 PWID were recruited from England and Northern Ireland. One in nine (11%; 29/260) PWID reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Fifteen percent (26/169) reported injecting more frequently in 2020 than in 2019; cocaine injection in the preceding four weeks increased from 17% (242/1456) to 25% (33/130).

Forest management decisions affect DDW dynamics based on the type of silvicultural harvest applied at the stand level and the administration of those treatments across the landscape. The Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) is a landscape-scale experiment that tests the effects of three forest management treatments, even-aged management (EAM), uneven-aged management (UAM), and no harvest management (NHM), on forest ecosystems in the Ozark Highlands region of Missouri. In this study, we evaluate the effects of stand-level silvicultural treatments (clearcutting and intermediate thinning in EAM; single-tree selection and group selection in UAM) and landscape-level forest management treatments (EAM, UAM, and NHM) on the volume of DDW and distribution across decay classes over a 21-year period. At the stand level, clearcutting resulted in the greatest short-term increase in DDW volume among the silvicultural treatments. Following harvest, the DDW was primarily within the undecayed classes during the first few years after harvest but shifted to the greater decay classes during the second decade after harvest. At the landscape level, the forest management treatments did not differ in total DDW volume through time, although EAM and UAM had greater amounts of undecayed DDW than NHM shortly after harvest. Across all treatments, the volume of DDW increased through time, likely due to effects of the forest management but also due to background tree mortality related to oak decline during the study period. Overall, our results show differences in effects of stand-level silvicultural treatments on DDW dynamics and highlight the need to consider both stand-level and landscape-level effects of forest management systems in decision making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coarse woody debris; Downed dead wood; Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project; Oak-hickory forest; Silvicultural system"

Based on the studies, graphical dependencies of the rejection coefficient on the specific output flux were constructed and analyzed. During the analysis, it was noted that with an increase in the output specific flow of the solvent, the rejection coefficient decreases. The reason for this is the boundary layers of fat and protein formed in the near-membrane layers, which prevents the passage of protein molecules through the pores of the membrane. For the theoretical calculation of the rejection coefficient and specific output flux, mathematical expressions are developed and numerical values of the values of empirical coefficients are obtained. The developed mathematical expressions describe the experimental data with good confidence.

Urban air mobility (UAM), i.e., the on-demand concept that utilizes eVTOL aircraft, might substantially reduce travel times when compared to ground-based transportation. Trips of three, pre-existent, and calibrated agent-based transport scenarios (Munich Metropolitan Region, Île-de-France, and San Francisco Bay Area) have been routed using the UAM-extension for the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) to calculate congested trip travel times for each trip’s original mode—i.e., car or public transport (PT)—and UAM. The resulting travel times are compared and allow the deduction of potential UAM trip shares under varying UAM properties, such as the number of stations, total process time, and cruise flight speed. Under base-case conditions, the share of motorized trips for which UAM would reduce the travel times ranges between 3% and 13% across the three scenarios. Process times and number of stations heavily influence these potential shares, where the vast majority of UAM trips would be below 50 km in range. Compared to car usage, UAM’s (base case) travel times are estimated to be competitive beyond the range of a 50-min car ride and are less than half as much influenced by congestion. © 2021 by the authors.

To address the environmental challenges, the proposed concepts are either hybrid-electric or all-electric vehicles enabled with propellers that rotate at lower speeds than conventional rotorcraft configurations, such as helicopters. However, the feasibility of UAM in the near future requires significant progress on the all-electric propulsion systems since current battery technology still falls short when compared with fossil fuel in terms of specific energy density. In this work, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the environmental footprint of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft for the UAM market. This methodology is applied to existing concepts for exploratory studies on mission critical performance and environmental parameters. All-electric aircraft were found to be feasible for the UAM segment from the performance perspective. However, further improvements in battery technology and electricity generation from renewable sources are required. Sustainable aviation fuels, such as Alcohol-To-Jet (ATJ) obtained from wheat straw, present a substantially lower environmental impact than conventional fuels while providing the same performance.

Moreover, an experimentally validated electrochemical-thermal (ECT) model is developed to elucidate the fast charging process and the degradation mode of UAM batteries, quantitatively capturing lithium plating during fast charging. We find that the LiBs for UAM applications are most prone to lithium plating due to their higher initial SOC required as the reserve for safety; nevertheless, the ATM method is effective in minimizing or preventing lithium plating in the high SOC range of 30-90%.

The outrunner electric motors that are commonly used, may be capable of generating noise that could contribute to the vehicle’s overall noise profile and could generate cabin noise. Understanding and predicting the noise requires more knowledge of the rotor vibrations and eventually a model to predict the frequencies of those vibrations. This work presents a measurement of the rotor vibrations of two different small-scale motors. Two techniques to measure the surface vibration were used. The displacement spectra are compared with acoustic measurements. A finite element analysis model is used to predict the rotor resonance frequencies. The predicted frequencies are in fair agreement with the experimentally observed vibration frequencies, but requires further work to understand discrepancies. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The proof-of-concept all-electric vehicle called “SureFly” was developed by Moog, Inc. A cooperative effort between NASA and Moog, Inc. has led to one of the first acoustic test datasets from an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle being developed for passenger and cargo. Results show propeller and possibly motor tones are important for the overall noise levels. The vehicle has four support arms each with a pair of contra-rotating propellers. Noise measurements show higher noise levels from the lower propellers, likely due to inflow distortion from the arms and top propellers. Possible motor noise was identified by calculating harmonics of the line frequency and comparing to the tones in the narrowband acoustic spectra and phased microphone array data. The acoustic far field was found to be about 100 ft away from the vehicle, but additional microphones are needed to provide a better assessment. Results show the presence of modulation for some test conditions. The work reported here is only for ground tests. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

However, operational uncertainties may degrade its effectiveness. In this paper, we quantify the effectiveness of strategic deconfliction in mitigating scheduled and unscheduled flight delays under operational uncertainty in the form of normally distributed departure and airborne errors. A range of demand levels representing early-stage UAM operations were simulated across a conceptual network of 3 vertiports in the San Francisco Bay Area. Three approaches to strategic deconfliction were simulated which varied the requirement for rescheduling into the existing schedule when an operation incurred departure or airborne error – a tight conformance requirement tied to the minimum spacing requirement; a relaxed conformance requirement comparable to that used for internal departure scheduling in Time-Based Flow Management; and no conformance requirement in which operations were never rescheduled into the existing scheduled – only replanned tactically. Results from these simulations were compared to a baseline that simulated tactical deconfliction without strategic deconfliction. Results suggest that departure and airborne delays under strategic deconfliction are highly sensitive to how much rescheduling is required into the existing schedule. Results applying strategic deconfliction with no conformance requirement, with departure and airborne error being accommodated tactically, showed significantly improved performance – even at relatively high demand and error variability. Future work should explore the safety and gaming implications of strategic deconfliction with such relaxed conformance requirements and compare its performance to using demand capacity balancing instead of strategic deconfliction. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

A federated speed-control-based conflict resolution algorithm is introduced first, including its rules of the road, data exchange requirement, and critical parameters. Two experiments were set up for the parametric study. The first investigates five parameters: look ahead time, resolution update interval, maximum allowed speed reduction, traffic flow interval, and crossing angle. The second experiment studies the uncertainty of departure time. Metrics associated with safety, efficiency, and conflict resolution effort were measured for each scenario. A Design Of Experiment (DOE) analysis was used to perform the multi-factor analysis for the first experiment. It revealed that the crossing angle and flow interval were the most critical parameters across all three metrics, followed by maximum allowed speed reduction. Look ahead time and resolution update interval were of minor significance to safety and conflict resolution effort, but had little to no effect on efficiency. The analysis of the second experiment showed that, given a flow rate, the fluctuation in departure time was absorbed by the conflict resolution algorithm, which resulted in a relatively small fluctuation in airborne delay. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The objective of use-case scenarios is to provide a hypothetical situation to elicit expert knowledge and feedback in a specific subject matter area. Use-case scenarios in the field of aviation, including UAM, can help to support the safe integration of these vehicles into the National Airspace System (NAS) through the examination of airspace procedures during non-routine events. Inherent in this type of research is the need to study in-flight non-routine scenarios that the UAM vehicle could encounter. Situations categorized as non-routine events are any events that occur outside of the original flight plan such as a mechanical malfunction or other in-flight emergency requiring special procedures, which can include diversions to a specified, or non-specified, emergency landing area. In specific instances, some non-routine events could be considered as “routine” during in-flight operations, such as the need to perform a go-around due to a balked landing. As the rate of technological expansion surrounding UAM grows rapidly in modern aviation, so does the need for research that focuses on the safe integration of these vehicles including research with a focus on the methods and development of airspace operational procedures. Research rooted in CTA methods provides a framework for developing use-case scenarios appropriate for environments where mental demands are substantial. Substantial mental demands exist while operating in the NAS for pilots, airline dispatchers, and air traffic controllers among many others. With the focus on UAM in mind, it is critical to frame a baseline use-case scenario using information as it pertains to current-day airspace operations. According to Dr. Robert R. Hoffman’s “Protocols for Cognitive Task Analysis,” one of the first steps to applying CTA methods to research is the concept of “bootstrapping” in which the researcher(s) familiarize themselves with the domain that is being studied. To formulate the non-routine flight mission use-case scenarios for the purpose of this potential NASA ATM-X UAM research study, and to inform the baseline use-case scenario, the practice of bootstrapping was utilized to acquire knowledge of current-day airspace procedures. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The success of UAM operations depends on reliable services under different urban weather conditions. However, the correlation between commuter travel patterns and daily weather patterns creates various impact levels. Hence, this study builds a UAM weather impact assessment module based on urban traveling traffic patterns and climatic conditions. The weather module can quantify the weather impact level, identify the most critical weather conditions, and help experts identify potential technology solutions. By taking the Chicago and Dallas regions as examples, the results show that the Chicago region is not preferable for UAM services (53% chance of unimpacted trips) in the winter than in the Dallas region (67% chance of unimpacted trips). The most severe weather phenomena are low temperature, snow, and low visibility in Chicago, while the “wind 15-20 knots” is the most common bad weather condition in both areas.

In particular, traffic congestions with huge delays, especially during rush hours are causing problems. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) solutions aim at utilizing the airspace above the city for personal transport by introducing potentially autonomous, small vertical take-off and landing vehicles to tackle this development. This paper explores the advantages of UAM, or air taxis, compared to ground-based taxicabs in terms of route lengths and travel time. For this, a simulation study was carried out for a European metropolitan area, namely the downtown of Hamburg, Germany. A number of places was identified within the area that would be suitable for carrying UAM hubs, so called vertidromes. The study was realized using DLR’s drone traffic scenario generator, including technology developed for the in-house 4D trajectory planning and deconfliction solution. Scenarios were based on publicly available map data from OpenStreetMap. The scenarios assume that a direct connection between two hubs is demanded in a regular, short interval of time. Both a UAM connection and a ground transport are then scheduled simultaneously, allowing a direct comparison of travel time and distance. Conflict-free routing is considered for the UAM system. A time saving of 50% for the pure travel time as well as a route length saving of up to 16% for the air taxi vs. taxicab connections could be deduced from the simulation. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

UAM is a concept mode of transportation designed to bypass ground congestion for time-sensitive, price-inelastic travelers using autonomous, electric aircraft with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. Airport ground access trips constitute a trip purpose that can utilize this mode. This study analyzes originating ground access trips for two major airports in the Dallas-Fort Worth region: Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL). First, a mode choice model is calibrated on the existing airport ground access behavior. UAM demand is then estimated using the developed model, airspace restrictions, and the results from UAM demand stated-preference surveys in literature. Airspace restrictions consist of unusable pieces of airspaces based on current air traffic patterns, where the placement of UAM vertiports and overflying of UAM vehicles are prohibited. The demand model considers the trajectories of the UAM vehicles, which navigate on pre-defined routes inside Class-B airspace to prevent Air Traffic Control (ATC) involvement requirements. This study includes sensitivity analyses of UAM demand to the cost per passenger mile (CPM), number of vertiports placed in the region, and other secondary factors like vertiport location, intermodal cost, fixed cost, and average speed. Corridors with significant UAM demand are identified from the spatial distribution of demand and potential bottlenecks in the UAM network. The findings predict up to 4% market share of UAM for trips to the airport at the optimistically lower fare of $2 per passenger mile (in addition to the fixed cost of $23) and a 50-vertiport UAM network. Average Value of Times (VOTs) for business and non-business travelers are estimated to be around $57/hr and $36/hr, respectively. Business travelers comprise three-quarters of the total UAM demand because of relatively higher VOTs. Airport access trips in Dallas-Fort Worth region have considerable potential for UAM if the trip's price is below $4 per passenger mile (in addition to the fixed cost of $23). © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

UAM vehicles will land and take-off at defined vertiports and airports, flying at low altitudes, through B, C, D, and E airspace. Urban air vehicles will share the airspace with conventional piloted aircraft and, in the low altitude, urban airspace, with emerging small, unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). FAA’s UAM CONOPS posits operation in urban air corridors under Community Based Rules. Even assuming VFR operation in these corridors, there are multiple urban air vehicle communication needs in the corridor. These communications face constraints of identifying available frequencies, achieving appropriate range, ascertaining quality of service, then implementation and management of the communications.

Future huge fleets of logistic UAVs need to be optimized in terms of high efficiency and low annoyance, and hence, require sophisticated design methodologies. This paper presents a conceptual design methodology and its related tool to support the study of UAVs throughout the early design phase. This supporting ability is accomplished through the adjustment and the update of the traditional aircraft and rotorcraft design methods and the implementation of an ad-hoc UAV database into the design sequence. Special attention is dedicated to the Mass Estimation model as it shows the main deviation from the classical aircraft design methods. The presented methodology is capable to deal with a variety of potential UAV concepts such as rotorcraft-derived and hybrid configurations, targeting a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capability. With this design methodology being validated, it may be applied to novel VTOL designs, allowing trade-off analyses to identify reasonable design spaces and select the best-suited configuration for the given design scope. In this work, the case study examined is a freight UAV as part of a green air cargo logistics chain.

UAM is a concept aerial transportation mode designed to bypass ground congestion using an electric vehicle with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. UAM vehicles are expected to be significantly quieter than traditional helicopters, but operate on a much larger scale. Commuter travel demand will not be uniformly distributed with operations concentrated in a small geographical area such as Central Business Districts (CBD) and short time windows such as morning or evening peak periods. The objective of this study is to evaluate the aircraft noise annoyance generated by commuter UAM operations using flight trajectories developed in a previous study estimating UAM commuter demand. This study estimates the noise level from overflying UAM vehicles in a full day of operation (24 hours) and identifies areas where the noise levels may pose a challenge to future UAM operations. Noise estimation is performed at the Census Block group level using the Day-Night Level (DNL) metric. We run a parametric analysis considering two scenarios in each region: the UAM vehicle has a 10 dBA and 15 dBA noise reduction compared to the Robinson R-44 helicopter. The findings indicate a considerable difference between the 10 dBA and 15 dBA reduction scenarios. Although challenging, achieving a 15-dBA reduction compared to a 10-dBA reduction could reduce land area with DNL value above 50 dBA by 94% and highly-annoyed population by 91% in Northern California. Similarly, in Dallas-Fort Worth, achieving a 15-dBA reduction compared to a 10-dBA reduction could reduce the land area with DNL value above 50 dBA by 80% and a highly annoyed population by 85%. Lastly, we analyze the high-demand vertiport in the San Francisco Financial District in the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to observe the DNL contours for the varying noise performance scenarios. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

While many of the aircraft developed for this concept have focused on vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, it has been demonstrated that fixed-wing aircraft using distributed electric propulsion (DEP) powered lift systems might be able to operate under similarly-constrained environments as short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft.

However, its viability as a transport mode will be strongly determined by benefits in travel time. Hence, before optimizing the planning and infrastructure provision for UAM’s deployment, the dynamics of UAM trips must first be simulated and understood in order to determine the total addressable market. This work contributes to the existing scholarship in several ways. First, we use an ultra-fast parallelized, GPU-based microsimulator, MANTA, to study the regional characteristics of UAM trips compared to driving trips, simulating millions of morning trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. Second, we provide a novel, data-driven approach to determine the demand of multi-modal UAM in different network designs, leveraging the speed of MANTA for iterative convergence. Third, we provide a granular yet regional-scale analysis of trips, showing congestion’s sensitivity to the number of vertiports as well as transfer times. The number of benefited trips from UAM increases most significantly when the vertiport network expands from 10 to 30 vertiports, with lesser but steady growth beyond 30 vertiports. Assuming a transfer time of 2 minutes at each of the origin and destination vertiports, results indicate that the average distance of trips that benefit from multi-modal UAM decreases, ranging from approximately 54 km to 30 km, as the number of vertiports increases incrementally from 10 to 100. Travel times on the ground improve at all network designs, but the extent of benefit increases as the number of vertiports increases. Finally, we note that there is an equity component to UAM, in which travelers who do not opt to take UAM at all still benefit from the efficiency increases in the transportation network. This suggests that at particular network designs and deployments, UAM can be valuable to an entire metropolitan area. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

However, before any of these vehicles see commercial flight they must be certified by the civil aviation authorities. The Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency in Europe are currently in the process of developing appropriate certification procedures. Instead of only focusing on creating new certification requirements, both agencies are looking into the option of adjusting present certifications for light aircraft. In particular, the FAA considers adjusting the Part 23 airworthiness standards with special conditions to allow for certification of eVTOL Urban Air Mobility vehicles (UAM). One of the hurdles prohibiting the use of Part 23 for certification of eVTOL vehicles is proper power and energy management. It must be ensured at all times that the vehicle has sufficient power available to perform critical flight maneuvers, sufficient energy stored in its batteries to safely complete the flight, and that this information is continuously communicated to the pilot or a control system. If the estimate of the power required to maintain a flight state or the energy required to safely complete a maneuver exceeds the available reserves, the pilot must be warned and provided with a suggested plan of actions. The aviation authorities also need tools to verify statements made by the aircraft manufacturers pertaining to achievable flight performance, range and safety margins, in order to assist them in the flight safety assessment and airworthiness certification process.

One important topic is the safety and security aspect. This paper discusses the safety and security considerations in the topic areas of: Safe autonomy, reliable multisensor navigation, robust and efficient communication, U-space and safe air traffic, and finally cyber-physical safety and security. As a basis for future discussion, the challenges and gaps are identified, furthermore the research in the context of the project is briefly outlined. From a safety perspective, the missing pilot of an autonomous vehicle is equivalent to a missing fallback layer, which has to be mitigated. Additionally, trust needs to be established for new techniques, specifically machine learning, which has recently gained massive interest. To solve this, verification, standardization, and regulation aspects of autonomy have to be addressed. The research is therefore targeted towards assessing and increasing the safety of autonomous operations. Moreover, a multi-sensor navigation system is necessary to achieve required safety levels in challenging environments, while meeting the cost and weight constraints. In order to ensure the integrity of the navigation system, an innovative integrity monitoring architecture for the multi-sensor solution will be investigated in the UAM context. Furthermore, many flying vehicles will need to share information in a reliable and trustworthy manner. Therefore, a robust and efficient communication system is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the future urban air mobility in order to mitigate midair collisions. To achieve safe air traffic, U-space services would have to be established. The project will specifically address gaps in the proposed services and identify additional required information and services. As a last aspect, the cyber physical safety and security has to be considered. With highly connected systems, attacks can happen over the Internet from virtually anywhere. Therefore, it is required to establish a holistic approach for cyber-physical safety and security. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.",

In this study, the influence of the Umbrella Arch Method (UAM) on controlling the tunneling-induced settlements under severe geotechnical conditions was assessed. To accomplish this objective, the tunnel excavation sequences, as well as the UAM deployment, were simulated through a series of finite element numerical modeling, considering the in-situ conditions associated with a case study. Post-processing of the numerical modeling results indicated that using the UAM resulted in a substantial reduction in the corresponding tunnel crown and ground surface settlements. Additionally, through a parametric analysis, design parameters of UAM pipes, in terms of geometrical and installation- related properties, were evaluated to provide relevant information on the optimized values for each individual parameter. The associated results showed that the optimum value of the pipe length is approximately 1.5 Dtunnel (the equivalent tunnel diameter).

Presently we do not have any superlogarithmic lower bound for the AM-complexity of an explicit function. Obtaining such a bound is a fundamental challenge to our understanding of communication phenomena. In this article we explore the gap between the known techniques and the complexity class AM. In the first part we define a new natural class, Small-advantage Layered Arthur-Merlin (SLAM), that has the following properties: • SLAM is (strictly) included in AM and includes all previously known subclasses of AM with non-trivial lower bounds: NP,MA,SBP,UAM ⊆ SLAM ⊂ AM . Note that NP ⊂ MA ⊂ SBP, while SBP and UAM are known to be incomparable. • SLAM is qualitatively stronger than the union of those classes: holds for an (explicit) partial function f . f ∈ SLAM \ (SBP ∪ UAM). holds for an (explicit) partial function f . • SLAM is a subject to the discrepancy bound: for any f (formua presented) In particular, the inner product function does not have an efﬁcient SLAM-protocol. Structurally this can be summarised as SBP ∪ UAM ⊆ SLAM ⊆ AM ∩ PP In the second part we ask why proving a lower bound of ω(√n) on the MA-complexity of an explicit function seems to be difficult. We show that such a bound either must explore certain “uniformity” of MA (which would require a rather unusual argument), or would imply a non-trivial lower bound on the AM-complexity of the same function. Both of these results are related to the notion of layer complexity, which is, informally,the number of “layers of nondeterminism” used by a protocol. © 2021 Dmitry Gavinsky.","Communication complexity; Complexity classes"

Therefore, detection systems can avoid accidents that cause material damage and injury for people. One way to avoid accidents caused by this type of vehicles is through the detection of cables and power lines with an embedded camera installed in each small UAS.

This is evident in the context of emerging UAS Traffic Management (UTM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operational paradigms, where a transition from Human-in-the-Loop to Human-on-the-Loop is required. As the nature of UAS/UAM traffic is inherently heterogeneous and rapidly changing, the resulting levels of complexity are expected to be much higher than in traditional ATM operations. Such complexity can be at least in part addressed by introducing suitable traffic clustering schemes to improve operational efficiency and reduce computational overheads. Traffic clustering algorithms typically adopted in flow management problems utilise aircraft trajectory data as a primary feature variable. However, this approach is not the most adequate for UAS traffic clustering because their mission profiles are affected by various factors, such as weight class, type of mission, and Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) capabilities. Therefore, a multi-criteria traffic clustering methodology is proposed in this paper, which provides a new, versatile and computationally efficient approach suitable for traffic flow optimisation in next generation DSS for UTM/UAM operations. A preliminary verification of the proposed clustering methodology is performed based on synthetic UAS/UAM traffic data around Melbourne's inner suburbs.

In UAM, an aircraft can operate in the corridors, i.e., the designated airspace, that link the aerodromes, thus avoiding the use of complex routing strategies such as those of modern-day helicopters. For safety, a UAM aircraft will use air-to-ground communications to report flight plan, off-nominal events, and real-time movements to ground base stations (GBSs). A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance in UAM, a stochastic geometry-based spatial model is developed. In particular, the distribution of GBSs is modeled as a Poisson point process (PPP), and the aircraft are distributed according to a combination of PPP, Poisson cluster process (PCP), and Poisson line process (PLP). For this setup, assuming that any given aircraft communicates with the closest GBS, the distribution of distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ra-tio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the aircraft-to-ground communication network in UAM. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity and provide useful UAM design guidelines by showing the connectivity performance under different parameter settings. © 2021 IEEE.",

The motor position sensor is one of the monitoring targets in UAMs, because it is in a harsh environment such as rain, ice, dust, vibration, etc. In this work, a resolver-based sensor method and a sensorless algorithm are fused in cooperative mode. Under normal conditions, the sensored angle and the sensorless angle are weighted equally. However, in case of sensor failure, only the sensorless method is selected. In other cases, only the sensored angle is fully respected. It is assumed here that the sensored method as well as the sensorless method may fail. To determine which of the two methods is faulty, the measured current is used as a reference. The virtual current is obtained by numerically solving the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) model in the stationary frame using the rotor angles.

This altitude information is normally called standard pressure altitude since it is computed from airborne pressure measurements performed by barometers and is referenced to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) Mean Sea Level (MSL) isobar surface. On the other hand, robust geodetic altitude navigation is fundamental for airport nearness operations with tighter requirements and plays a key role for new applications like Urban Air Mobility (UAM). However, the deviations of standard pressure altitude from true geodetic altitude can reach up to several hundreds of meters and therefore its application is limited to relative vertical navigation. The barometric measurements can nevertheless still be used to determine geodetic altitude if additional weather information like pressure and temperature is available and some transformations are applied. This paper first presents a methodology to compute geodetic altitude from a corrected pressure altitude obtained with airborne pressure measurements and external weather data. Flight data is used to assess the achievable geodetic altitude accuracy from 20 flight hours with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Dassault Falcon 20-ES aircraft. Second, one linear model is derived to mitigate residual errors that dependent on flight dynamics. Finally and based on the available flight data, first robust stochastic error models are proposed to support the adoption of barometric pressure measurements for safe geodetic altitude navigation. In particular, two models are derived. The first one provides a Gaussian overbound for the computed geodetic altitude so that it can be used either directly as altitude information or in combination with other sensors in snapshot (e.g., least-squares) estimators. The second is a dynamic model that bounds the power spectral density of the error with a first-order Gauss Markov process. In this way this model can be easily incorporated in a sequential estimator, like a Kalman filter, and in combination with other sensors. © 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

FaceQgen does not require labelled quality measures for training. It is trained from scratch using the SCface database. FaceQgen applies image restoration to a face image of unknown quality, transforming it into a canonical high quality image, i.e., frontal pose, homogeneous background, etc. The quality estimation is built as the similarity between the original and the restored images, since low quality images experience bigger changes due to restoration. We compare three different numerical quality measures: a) the MSE between the original and the restored images, b) their SSIM, and c) the output score of the Discriminator of the GAN. The results demonstrate that FaceQgen's quality measures are good estimators of face recognition accuracy. Our experiments include a comparison with other quality assessment methods designed for faces and for general images, in order to position FaceQgen in the state of the art. This comparison shows that, even though FaceQgen does not surpass the best existing face quality assessment methods in terms of face recognition accuracy prediction, it achieves good enough results to demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised learning approaches for quality estimation (in particular, data -driven learning based on a single high quality image per subject), having the capacity to improve its performance in the future with adequate refinement of the model and the significant advantage over competing methods of not needing quality labels for its development.

Pioneering urban airspace design projects expect the air vehicles to fit into structured UAM corridor networks. However, most existing air transport networks are not capable of handling the increasing traffic demand, which is likely to cause congestion, traffic complexity, and safety issues. To adapt the increasing demand to the current airspace capacity, a novel macroscopic traffic assignment model is proposed to mitigate the congestion and organize the structure of air traffic flow. Firstly, the UAM corridor is designed and fitted into graph representation. Then, a traffic assignment problem based on linear dynamic system is formalized to minimize the congestion factors and the intrinsic air traffic complexity. A two-step resolution method based on Dafermos’s algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve this optimization problem. A case study is carried out on a two-layer air transport network with intensive UAM operations. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully mitigate urban airspace congestion and organize the UAM traffic into a low-complexity flow pattern.

A collaborative SoS framework with an agent-based simulation is introduced, which connects the UAM vehicle design, fleet performance, vertiport network, and re-energizing infrastructure with a Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). The framework is used to simulate four exemplary UAM fleet-operation scenarios based on two cities and two operational modes, namely urban and suburban operations. Different vehicle design configurations, e.g. multirotor and lift + cruise vehicles, are evaluated in each scenario based on respectively realistic Concepts of Operations (CONOPS). Additionally, two different points in time, namely 2025 and 2050, are considered and assessed for powering the vehicles by taking into account the characteristics of batteries as well as the underlying electricity mix for their operation. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide battery and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered. The SoS framework helps to asses various UAM metrics such as the average wait time for a passenger, the ideal number of aircraft needed for transporting all passengers within given time, the energy required on a vehicle and fleet level, sustainability metrics, e.g. the global warming potential associated with the energy carriers and many more.

After having established several scenarios dealing with UAM vehicles and describing the acoustic characteristics of a variety of potential air-taxi concepts, a broader study on UAM traffic management has been performed by the author. Because of the large number of different air taxi concepts and their multiple operational conditions, each with its own sound characteristics, a deeper knowledge of future air-taxis’ noise emissions will be crucial for the understanding of situations around vertiports and air-taxi routes.

In this study, one typical propeller, the T-motor 15x5 propeller, was analyzed by use of the commercial CFD software, ANSYS FLUENT V19.3. The effects of gravity and convection were analyzed to determine the noise characteristics at altitude using the FW-H equation. A high-altitude drone, which operates at heights from 0 to 10 km with 1,000 to 5,000 revolutions per minute, was analyzed using the steady-state k-w SST turbulence model. And using the steady-state data to initialize values, an unsteady analysis was performed with the LES turbulence model. The time step was divided based on the 1-degree rotational time, and the velocity residual on each axis was calculated until a value of 10-7 or less was achieved and there was no fluctuation of thrust, at which point it was considered converged. The CFD results were validated with the experimental results for thrust and their results show that the maximum error was 8.64%. The overall sound pressure level was calculated, and noise characteristics in the audible frequency range according to receiver points were also compared. Through this study, thrust and noise data according to altitude were provided. The aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics at high-altitudes, which are generally difficult to measure by experiment, are also presented. Therefore, the appropriate operating altitudes and rotational speeds will be presented through the aeroacoustics analysis corresponding to operational altitude, and the basic research data can then be applied to upcoming unmanned aircraft system (UAS) market. © 2021 by ASME.","Aeroacoustics; Altitudes; Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation; Propeller; UAM; UAV"

The second method applies a flow interval, predefined to accommodate the capability of the conflict resolution, through the departure scheduler at the origin. High-density operation scenarios, where conflicts can not be completely resolved by the conflict resolution function alone, were used to study the performance of these two coordination methods.

Therefore, we propose a new performance assessment concept to predict and evaluate the performance of a vertidrome’s airside traffic flow with respect to specific stakeholder requirements, here defined as the passenger, the VTOL-vehicle operator and the vertidrome operator. Based on their individual objectives, each stakeholder defines a specific performance indicator, which in this paper is including but not limited to delay and punctuality.

However, the detrimental impact of mining to the country has also been heavily criticized as it causes massive potential destruction to environment and wildlife ecology such as acid mine drainage and contaminant leaching, soil erosion, and tailing impoundments among others. These conflicting interests are reflected in the mining discourses stoked or dimmed by media, which influence the readers’ construal of meanings in the mining texts, social actors’ roles in the mining industry, and the urderlying contexts of the mining reality. Drawing on critical discourse analysis, this study described the linguistic and discursive features of Philippine mining discourse in media texts. The study used 224 news articles published by three online portals within five years. Local news reports and peripheral discourses obtained through interviews with local “symbolic elites” in the identified mining communities and other archival documents supplemented the news texts. The UAM Corpus Tool, a software for linguistic tagging, complemented the manual analysis in identifying the social actor theme. Findings revealed that government actions, economic phenomenon, and political actors are the most prevalent themes in the mining news reports. Moreover, results showed that local news tends to focus more on the mining’s environmental impact, whereas the national news tends to put more premium on the mining’s economic impact. This means that the media allotted a much lesser spatio-temporal space for the environment and Indigenous Peoples’ cause. The findings further invalidate the assumptions that mining discourse is primarily concerned with environmental related issues. © 2021, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

This document summarizes performance and attribute analyses of leading UAM configurations and compares to helicopters as an alternative configuration. The overall conclusion is that multirotor configurations' speed and range are inherently inadequate for military applications.

Modeling and analyzing rotorcraft flight dynamics, handling-qualities, and pilot interaction requires sophisticated tools to capture the complex physical phenomena germane to their operation. Present and future rotorcraft operational requirements demand the vehicles perform in new and increasingly austere environments. Initiatives such as the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envision an expansion of pilot training to allow non-expertly trained pilots to safely operate UAM vehicles, aided by sophisticated autonomous systems. Pilot-vehicle interaction studies in the past have largely focused on assessing the control system design, including robustness of the controller to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances, and the handling qualities of the pilot-vehicle system. In this analysis the pilot model is generally formulated to reflect a well-trained pilot; however, programs such as the UAM advocate for pilots of varying skill levels and proficiency. As such, this article investigates pilot-vehicle interactions across a range of uncertainties present in both the plant and pilot models to reflect this spectrum of pilot variability. This technique is also applicable to fleets with more qualified pilots as there is still a range of pilot tendencies and preferences.

Three 544kg (1200lb) aircraft are considered in hover with disk loadings of 287N/m2, 574N/m2, and 861N/m2 (6psf, 12psf, and 18psf), corresponding to rotor radii of 1.2m, 0.86m, and 0.70m (4.0ft, 2.8ft, and 2.3ft). Optimized explicit-model-following controllers are designed to meet standard handling qualities criteria using CONDUIT. In trim, it is seen that increased disk loading results in increased power, but with reduced motor torque due to higher rotor speeds. Time domain simulations are considered in order to examine the peak torque required by the aircraft, which is used to estimate required motor weight. Based on a step command in heave rate, a 54% reduction (total reduction of 40.6kg) in motor weight is seen for the 18psf quadcopter. Assuming a step change in rotor speed, the peak torque required for the heave maneuver is also predicted in closed form using an analytical model based on momentum and blade element theory. The analytical model captures the trend in peak torque during the heave rate step response, with predicted values within 12% of the values from the time domain simulation.

Investigations of the acoustics are performed on four overlap configurations, 0%, 5%, 15%, and 25%, in hover via high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. CFD simulations are carried out using the HPCMP CREATETM-AV Helios and acoustics calculations are conducted using PSU-WOPWOP. Blade airloads and performance of the rotors are computed for this study. Predictions on the rotor airloads and wake geometry are compared for all overlap configurations at a collective pitch angle of 8°. It is shown that the 25% overlap configuration yields a higher overall sound pressure level (OASPL) than for the other overlap configurations, mainly due to stronger blade-vortex-interactions at the entrance and exit locations of the overlap region. It is found that the OASPL difference in hover is above 62 dB at an altitude of 500 ft (152.4 m), which is the UAM aircraft noise guideline suggested by Uber. Additionally, noise for all overlap cases are compared against various background noise levels. Results show that noise from the side-by-side rotor could not be fully concealed by the various background noise at an altitude of 500 ft (152.4 m). Copyright © 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

A nominal flight controller is tuned to meet handling qualities specifications for the healthy aircraft in forward flight, and a robust two-plant controller is tuned to also satisfy the same set of handling qualities specifications following front rotor failure. This two-plant controller is tuned to simultaneously meet the handling qualities for the healthy and failed aircraft. In both cases, the flight controllers do not utilize knowledge of the rotor failure. The performance of the controllers is compared for single rotor failures of the front and side rotors. For front rotor failures, the two plant controller decreases the peak pitch deviation by 3.5◦ and provides a more well damped response, but does not provide significant benefit during side rotor failure. Various maneuvers are also performed for each controller to evaluate the cost for using the robust controller in normal operation. The largest torque difference, a pitch doublet, requires 8 ft-lb additional torque for the two-plant controller, while the peak torque requirement for maneuvers occurs during a yaw rate step, where about 140 ft-lb of torque is required for the nominal controller (143 ft-lb for the two-plant). For both controllers, recovery following rotor failure requires substantially more torque (280 ft-lb) than the different maneuvers considered.

The heave and yaw axes demand more actuator usage than the roll and pitch axes. Between heave and yaw, heave was the more demanding of the two because of the dependence of heave on the engine speed controller (ESC). When the feedback gains for all three vehicles were optimized to Level 1 handling qualities (HQs) specifications using CONDUIT, the ESC for the octocopter was the most stable and had the highest rise time (time for the rotor to respond to an input), while the LPC ESC was the least stable and had the smallest rise time. Rise time corresponds to the time required for rotor response. When actuator usage was translated to current margin, torque margin, and power margin, heave was the most demanding axis, followed by yaw, roll, and then pitch for all three vehicles.

To become an airline pilot, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires 1,500 flying hours. The costs of training a pilot with zero flying experience coming into the training are in the range of 90,000-100,000.

Regionalization is carried out using graph-based clustering technique called SKATER (Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal) to group the regions having similar characteristics and address the compound effect of both population and spatial information. By classifying the regions into five categories through correspondence analysis, the operational and economic feasibility of each region is evaluated.

However, since the time scale of turbulence generating the broadband noise is much smaller than the rotor period, it is physically-valid to construct a spectrum using a time period much less than the rotor period. The objective of this paper is to explore the importance of this unique viewpoint on rotor broadband noise prediction. Modulation of the blade self-noise spectrum during a blade passage or rotor period was observed for rotors in hover and forward flight-in both noise predictions and flight test data. Even for axisymmetric deterministic loading, modulation of the spectrum was still observed, due to convective amplification, retarded-time effects, and the blade position changes relative to the observer. Time variation of noise directivity was found to be dominant towards the advancing side of the rotor, and within ±30◦ of the rotor disk plane. Overall, the time variation of the broadband self-noise spectrum was found to be important in the test cases, and is expected to be an important consideration for helicopters and urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft. © 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

This paper seeks to examine three possible approaches to improve operator and community acceptance - specifically targeting cost, safety, and noise. First, the conceptual design space will be examined for VTOL amphibious vehicle technologies, including the implications of on-water versus in-flight time/speed. Second, the implications of minimizing community overflights by flying over-water will be examined. Third, the implications of the partial use of on-water, or near-shore/littoral, vertiports on UAM network performance will be examined. This study considers an alternate design trade space for urban aerial mobility systems. A large number of cities in the United States are located near or surround large bodies of water. Many of these same cities are considered to be candidates for metropolitan aerial transportation systems so as to moderate the impact of urban ground-transportation congestion. This paper will expand discussion and study of notional amphibious VTOL vehicles. There is nothing particularly new with regards to helicopters with amphibious takeoff and landing capability. For example, light rotorcraft have been outfitted with pontoons since the 1950s. Larger utility helicopters - used for carrying offshore oil-rig crew - have been designed, with varying degrees of success, to emergency land in rough waters in case of onboard mechanical system failures. The unique difference for the proposed amphibious UAM vehicles, as compared to these earlier amphibious rotorcraft, is that water operation is the norm rather than the exception and that, further, the water-born operation (and design) of such vehicles can be optimized to yield significant economic and operational benefits over solely UAM land-based stations and operations. Various different amphibious UAM networks will be discussed. A first-order set of analyses - employing novel mission metrics - is presented in this paper that will examine the operational performance of these amphibious networks. In particular, amphibious operations might address critical safety and community acceptance issues. An examination of the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics of amphibious VTOL UAM vehicles will be presented in this paper. One possible conceptual design for an amphibious UAM vehicle is a hybrid synchropter/hydroplane vehicle. As interest in urban aerial mobility grows, it is worthwhile to consider whether or not amphibious vertical takeoff and landing vehicles can play an important role in providing such mobility. © 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

Dynamic gust encounters due to urban terrain and neighboring aircraft can affect safety and ride quality, impacting community acceptance of UAM systems. Aircraft concepts currently under consideration for UAM systems differ significantly from conventional helicopters through use of multiple small prop-rotors distributed over the airframe. If a subset of these prop-rotors experiences large variations in inflow, the changing thrust could produce upsetting moments and dynamic responses with frequency response characteristics that may cause motion sickness and/or general discomfort to passengers. Thus, operation in the terminal area environment has the potential to negatively affect ride quality or result in loss of control accidents. Furthermore, notional aircraft concepts have complex aerodynamic interactions between the prop-rotor wakes and airframe, which are challenging from a modeling perspective. It is desirable to develop modeling and simulation tools for eVTOL aircraft handling / ride qualities analysis and flight control development to support development of air vehicle and UAM system development. This paper describes results of a research and development study of modeling methods and application toward an UAM ride quality and safety assessment tool.

An accurate vehicle simulator with realistic parameters is presented to compare in simulation the proposed architecture with a conventional underactuated VTOL vehicle that shares the same physical properties. In order to make fair comparisons, controllers are obtained solving an optimization problem in which the cost function of both systems is chosen to be equivalent.

This success goes hand in hand with the need to explain and understand their decisions: opening the black box. The problem of attribution specifically deals with the characterization of the response of Convolutional Neural Networks by identifying the input features responsible for the model’s decision. Among all attribution methods, perturbation-based methods are an important family based on measuring the effect of perturbations applied to the input image in the model’s output. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel perturbation-based attribution method guided by semantic segmentation. Our method inhibits specific image areas according to their assigned semantic label. Hereby, perturbations are link up with a semantic meaning and a complete attribution map is obtained for all image pixels. In addition, we propose a particularization of the proposed method to the scene recognition task which, differently than image classification, requires multi-focus attribution models. The proposed semantic-guided attribution method enables us to delve deeper into scene recognition interpretability by obtaining for each scene class the sets of relevant, irrelevant and distracting semantic labels.

Internet giants are seeing the plight of identity authentication. To address this issue, unified access management (UAM) was conceived. This paper provides a novel unified access management scheme, named SGX-UAM, with one-time passwords (OTPs) based on Intel software guard extensions (SGX). SGXUAM outperforms generic UAM for providing resistance to most client attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, phishing attacks, most replay attacks and most denial of service (DoS) attacks to which generic UAMimplementaions are vulnerable. Specifically, client attacks are prevented by ensuring input security and memory security, where the former is achieved through shuffle mapping and ""periodic hooking"" strategy, the latter is mainly guaranteed by Intel SGX; MITM attacks are prevented by transferring ciphertext rather than plaintext; phishing attacks are avoided by authorization control; replay attacks cannot succeed because we adopts OTPs, which contain time-related dynamic factors that expire in a few seconds; as for DoS attack, we blunted its edge by blocking-invocation for identical user connection. SGX-UAM also differs from generic UAM in that it relieves the security concerns of sevice providers (SPs) and protects users' privacy at little cost of performance. An exceptional value of SGX-UAM is that it brings a lightweight OTP solution that eliminates the need of additional hardware devices, thus reducing the costs. The experimental results show that SGX-UAM consumes almost the same time with OpenID and OAuth2.0 for one login request and performs steadily when handling sequential login requests. Furthermore, the resource usage for SGX-UAM is acceptable. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is an effective short-term intervention for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after multiple traumatic experiences, such as those experienced by UAM. Within the existing literature, there is a lack of research investigating unaccompanied minors' experiences of NET or any trauma-focused therapy. Participants were four UAM experiencing PTSD who formed part of a pilot delivery of NET within a dedicated child and adolescent mental health service for refugee children. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). This project identified five themes that encapsulated unaccompanied minors' experiences of receiving NET, including the process of preparing for this therapy, what it was like to receive it, and the differences they identified at the end of treatment. The significance of this taking place within a safe therapeutic relationship was explored within the context of the attachment losses experienced by UAM, and the impact this has on emotion regulation was considered. The potential of a reduction in PTSD symptoms facilitating a positive spiral in adolescence was reflected on within this paper. Key learning aims (1)To understand the experience of unaccompanied asylum-seeking minors (UAM) receiving narrative exposure therapy (NET) for post-traumatic stress disorder. (2)To understand the key concerns and motivators for UAM when considering engaging in NET.

A quasi-steady aerodynamic formulation is implemented to calculate the aerodynamic loads on all lifting surfaces. In addition to the conventional control surfaces of the fixed-wing aircraft, such as elevator, aileron, and rudder, both tilt angle and rotational speed of each rotor are considered the control inputs in the formulation of nonlinear flight dynamics.

RAM-C is designed to estimate models appropriate for flight dynamics studies and simulations. The approach responds to a demand for experimental efficiency and model fidelity that has increased with growing aircraft complexity and aerodynamic nonlinearities associated with hybrid and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. In an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) transportation system, it is expected that aircraft will embrace many features from both airplanes and rotorcraft. These vehicles present many more factors than conventional aircraft which can lead to increased computational costs and missed key factor interactions when applying traditional testing and modeling methods.

It combines and extends concepts from design of experiment theory and aircraft system identification theory that allow the user the freedom to choose, in advance of the test, a specific level of fidelity in terms of prediction error. RAM-C only collects enough data required to meet the user-specified prediction error requirements thus saving computational time and resources.

An acoustic analysis framework is developed to evaluate this noise from subscale data. Electrically driven rotors have strong tonal characteristics resulting from aerodynamic phenomena and motor noise, and adding a duct to the rotors is a possible noise reduction technique. An open and ducted rotor are operated with a linear array of microphones measuring the sound generated. This sound data is simulated with notional flight paths and evaluated using current noise metrics. It is evident that the flight path chosen for simulation has a significant impact on the noise exposure for ground observers. For both the open and ducted rotors, the Effective Perceived Noise Level and Sound Exposure Level are analyzed, though neither sufficiently account for the tonality of these rotors. Narrowband spectra show that the duct broadens the rotor tones and increases the broadband noise and the overall sound pressure level, for static conditions. However, the duct appears to significantly shield motor noise which is a point source as opposed to the distributed aerodynamic noise sources. These insights may help designers weigh the decision to use ducted rotors, as well as specifying flight paths for their vehicles.

This paper focuses on studying different configurations of MESC cells distributed inside an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft wing structure. The 2-D cross-sectional properties of the wing with and without MESC cell are calculated using Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis. These properties are applied to a strain-based geometrically nonlinear beam formulation to simulate the dynamic behavior of UAM aircraft’s wing. The wing deformation from the static analysis of the wing during the level flight is compared. The results indicate that the aircraft with MESC cell along the entire wing span has the lower wing deformation due to a higher weight of the batteries, reducing the wing tip displacement. The aeroelastic stability of the different cases of MESC cell distribution is analyzed. The most stable aircraft is the case without MESC cells in the structure, while the least stable is the case with MESC cells in the wing roots. The aircraft with the best results considering the static analysis, stability analysis, and the total aircraft weight was the aircraft with MESC cell in the wing tips only.

The limitations and off-nominal operational considerations generally postulated during traditional safety analysis may not be complete or correct for new technologies. While a lot of the literature surveyed focuses on improving traditional methods of safety analysis, it still does not completely address the limitations caused due to insufficient knowledge and experience with transformative technologies. The research objective of the present work is to integrate the Bayesian safety assessment framework developed previously by the authors with conceptual and 6-DoF performance models for DEP aircraft to evaluate off-nominal performance and reliability using information that is typically available in conceptual or preliminary design phases.

The consideration behind flying taxis in Singapore serves to smoothen traffic congestions in the central and industrial areas due to occasional traffic jams caused by road works or accidents, providing greater transportation convenience in a cosmopolitan city. Firstly, the research focused on the demand in terms of cost, travel time and the travel distance for various modes of conventional transport across Singapore. Eight reference mission scenarios were analysed in line with real-time traffic and fare-time patterns were studied to understand how passengers could benefit from it, in terms of time and cost savings. Secondly, the research was narrowed down to the Central Business District (CBD) and focused on tourists’ transport demands using statistics provided by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). The goal is to determine which districts had the most in-demand and how tourists could benefit by taking a flying taxi.

This paper describes the methodology used for wind tunnel testing of the Langley Aerodrome No. 8 (LA-8) in the NASA Langley 12-Foot Low-Speed Tunnel during multiple test entries in 2019 and 2020. The LA-8 is a tandem tilt-wing aircraft with 4 motor-propeller units and 4 control surfaces distributed across each wing, plus an inverted V-tail with 2 ruddervators on the fuselage. An initial tunnel entry used one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) testing to (1) define candidate trimmed transition corridors between vertical and horizontal flight, (2) assess whether there was adequate control authority, and (3) define appropriate test factor ranges for subsequent design of experiment (DOE) wind tunnel testing. The total number of independent variables for these wind tunnel tests (23) made DOE testing an efficient option for assessing the large number of potential interactions associated with the LA-8. The general advantages and disadvantages of OFAT and DOE wind tunnel testing techniques are also discussed – along with the benefits of a combined approach. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

An understanding of the potential demand for UAM services is crucial for stakeholders to ensure that the supporting infrastructure is ready and does not hinder the introduction of these services. In a previous study, the authors developed a top-down methodology for evaluating the demand for global UAM networks by estimating the travelers’ willingness to pay for services and estimating the potential volume of UAM traffic. The methodology was implemented in that study for a subset of 31 cities distributed across the world in 2035. This paper seeks to expand the scope of the previous study to quantify global UAM demand for 542 of the top global cities in an extended time frame from 2035 up to 2050.

Therefore, urban air mobility/air taxis are proposed as a solution to this overwhelming problem. As a consequence, this study is focused on determining the number of feasible trips that could fly over an urban area (in this study, the City of Chicago) considering passenger costs for the air taxi trip using short-, medium-, and long-term operating cost models suggested by Uber. To estimate the number of trips, the study starts with historical data recording the number of commutes in the city together with the origin and destination coordinates for these commute trips. The distribution of these commutes over one day estimates the number of trips at a given hour of the day. The Open Trip Planner API calculates the duration of these commutes, which allows calculation of the effective cost of the trip when using an air taxi for part of the trip. The computational model for this study compares the effective cost of a trip using the air taxi, for part of all the trip, to the effective costs of using only ground-based public transit or a passenger-owned automobile for the same trip. Trips where effective cost is lowest when using air taxi provide a count of the number of UAM trips conducted over the city. Following this initial estimate of the urban airspace density, the model can subsequently assess the impact of additional considerations about restricted areas of the city (in Chicago, the class B airspace for Midway Airport, is one example). Thereby, a first approach of feasible routes is implemented using an optimization path algorithm. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.",

To address these requirements, thermoplastic composites are explored to utilize their weight, mechanical, toughness and durability properties to comply with structural requirements. In addition, thermoplastic composites open the possibility to fastener-free assembly technologies, such as induction welding, allowing composite structures to be assembled through local melting and re-solidifying, without the need for mechanical fasteners or adhesives. However, during the induction welding process undesired localized hot-spots can occur near the edges of a part, resulting in subpar quality of the joint and an unwanted surface finish (thermal based delamination). To better understand how the hot-spots occur, a detailed investigation by analyzing the current flow through the thermoplastic composite laminate layers is performed. The analysis was done using an in-house development mixed boundary element (BE) / finite element (FE) software code, WelDone. For a laminated thermoplastic composite, it is shown that the current flow is influenced by the electromagnetic (EM) field generated by the induction coil. The induction coil shape dictates the current flow in a specified direction, and together with the material architecture and anisotropic conductivity of the thermoplastic composite, a build-up of current near an edge can occur, matching in experimentally observed hot-spots during the induction welding process. At last, the current build-up at edges in a metal is investigated as well, and the differences between a metallic monolithic plate and a composite laminate are discussed. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

To efficiently interact with the flight control system, the HMI and especially its control inceptors are highly adapted to the vehicle’s configuration and its flight control system’s degree of automation. In Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts, VTOL transition vehicles emerge while combining beneficial characteristics of two underlying aircraft configurations. In this paper, a HMI concept comprising novel control inceptor designs for transition VTOL aircraft, is proposed. Together with the implemented flight control system, Simplified Vehicle Operation (SVO) shall ensure intuitive and unified control behavior across the whole flight envelope. Considering future certification aspects of such a system, the actual Handling Qualities (HQ) are evaluated and compared against Minimum Acceptable Handling Qualities Rating (MAHQR) published by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). These MAHQR need to be achieved for demonstrating compliance to EASA’s SC-VTOL, the regulatory framework for certification of VTOL aircraft. Pilot-in-the-Loop (PIL) experiments are conducted in a simulative environment to determine the actual HQ with Cooper-Harper Rating (CHR). A UAM example mission containing all flight phases of a transition VTOL aircraft is the PIL experiments’ basis. The results show that the overall SVO concept, including flight control system and HMI, would meet the proposed MAHQR and enables also participants without classical piloting skills to operate a transition VTOL aircraft in a satisfactory manner. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This quest has given the impetus to the industry to invest in new technologies such as autonomous systems enabling self-driving vehicles. In this context, the concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a term used for short-distance, on-demand, highly automated, passenger or cargo-carrying air mobility services, has arisen. This paper presents the introduction phase of strategic planning for the era of urban air mobility focusing on user and citizen acceptance of the system required for its operation. A survey is designed to capture the perception of citizens and potential users on aspects such as safety, security, well-being of the society (including issues of aesthetics, quality of life, social impacts), driving behaviour, mobility behaviour, expected benefits and their impact on the acceptance and the intention to use these systems. The acceptance of citizens and potential users (considered as two different groups) is analysed in terms of its potential uses (e.g. health emergencies, leisure, connectivity to remote regions). The survey is applied to the Metropolitan area of Lisbon and 207 responses were gathered. The collected data was analysed through correlation analysis and non-parametric tests.

To support this, experiments in present day devices are needed to assess its effectiveness as a radiator and to study its compatibility with key aspects of reactor operation. For these purposes, accurate measurement of the Ar density in the confined plasma region are required. Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy is capable of providing this information, but requires validated cross-sections to produce accurate density profiles. For typical ASDEX Upgrade plasma parameters Ar+16 is the charge state of the most interest and the ArXVI n = 15-14 was identified as the best target for these measurements. Due to the fine structure splitting, the Ar charge exchange (CX) emission lines are highly asymmetric and detailed modeling is required to extract accurate ion temperatures or rotations. For the evaluation of Ar+16 densities, there are two main sets of CX cross-sections available: the data calculated by Schultz et al (Whyte et al 2010 J. Phys. B At. Mol. Opt. Phys 43 144002, Schultz et al 2010 J. Phys. B At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 144002) (ORNL) and by Errea et al (2006 J. Phys. B At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 39 L91) (UAM). These cross-sections differ by over an order of magnitude and have very different energy dependencies. In this work, the validity of these datasets is tested experimentally. The Ar density profiles calculated using the ORNL cross-sections are 10-50 too large while the UAM densities are a factor of 2.73 too small. The UAM data, however, does a much better job at capturing the observed energy dependence. The authors conclude that the CTMC calculations of Errea, which use a hydrogenic distribution to describe the initial target and donor distributions better reproduce the experimental data. However, to produce accurate Ar density profiles, these cross-sections need to be corrected downward and the best profiles are produced with a small correction to the UAM energy dependence. © EURATOM 2020.",

However, there has been a concern that CS’s contact with inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) can cause neurons to degenerate and cause sensory dysfunction. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the neurosensory function after surgical treatment with or without the application of CS. Methods: While controlling the effects of sex, age, follow-up period, and invasion size of the tumor, we performed the binary logistic regression analysis to examine whether or not the sensory function of the patients who were treated with CS (n = 19) for the cyst enucleation procedure was significantly different from those who were not treated with CS (n = 58) at the end of the follow-up period. Results: The logistic regression result showed that the use of CS was not significantly related to the normalness of sensory function at the end of the follow-up period. Rather, the invasion size of the cyst was significantly associated with sensory dysfunction. Conclusions: CS may be used for patients who are diagnosed with OKC and UAM without much fear of its impact on sensory dysfunction. However, a small number of patients who were treated with CS experienced severe sensory damage and did not recover at the end of the follow-up period, suggesting the need for further analysis of these patients. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carnoy’s solution; Hypoesthesia; Inferior alveolar nerve damage; Paresthesia; Sensory dysfunction"

However, the concept of misrecognition, as the opposite of recognition, is less featured. This article studies the experiences of misrecognition using evidence from the lived experience of underaged unaccompanied asylum-seeking boys in Finland. Drawing from conceptualizations of (mis)recognition and qualitative data created with 18 unaccompanied asylum-seeking boys living in residential care, we firstly look at how the boys articulate their experience of being seen as ‘refugees’. Secondly, we study how they respond to the refugee label. The findings show that the refugee stigma is mainly experienced as misrecognition, which influences the ways the young asylum-seekers strive to construct agentic identities. Four ways of responding to this misrecognition are identified: adopting a diminished identity (resigning), standing up against misrecognition (resisting), acting to prove the prejudice they encounter wrong (conforming), and claiming ordinariness (performing). We argue that the misrecognition experiences of unaccompanied asylum seeking minors offer a valuable lens for deepening our understanding of young people's responses to adverse conditions. Their varying responses to misrecognition provide important insights into how social work and the care system can be more attentive to the experiences of marginalized children and young people. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agency; Institutional care; Misrecognition; Recognition; unaccompanied asylum-seeking minors (UAM); Young people"

Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4. The insights obtained in this paper could assist any air taxi company in providing better customer service when they venture into the market. © 2020 The AuthorsIndustrial engineering; Systems engineering; Environmental assessment; Information science; Psychology; Air taxi; Helicopter services; Text analytics; Online customer reviews; Urban air mobility (UAM); Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) © 2020 The Authors","Air taxi; Environmental assessment; Helicopter services; Industrial engineering; Information science; Online customer reviews; Psychology; Systems engineering; Text analytics; Urban air mobility (UAM); Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)"

However, the existing methods pay more attention to estimate saturations of hydrate or free gas instead of QC. QC is difficult to be estimated because of its limited and unclear influences on velocities in the hydrate-bearing sediments. A workflow was proposed to estimate QC from core to logging to seismic inversion whose core technologies were an unconsolidated anisotropic model (UAM) and an inverse modeling approach. We used the UAM to construct the quantitative relationships between physical properties including QC and velocity. Then, the velocities of the reservoirs were obtained by logging-constrained seismic inversion. Finally, QC can be scaled by the inverse modeling of the UAM. To build the UAM, we analyzed the physical properties of hydrate reservoirs based on the cores and logging while drilling (LWD) data in the Shenhu area, South China Sea, and characterized unconsolidated sediments with horizontally layered hydrates and gas occurrences. The calculated P-velocities and S-velocities from the UAM agreed with the LWD data when the input variables were QC, porosity, hydrate saturation, and gas saturation. Conversely, for a group of P-velocity and S-velocity from seismic inversion, the corresponding QC can be scaled out as well as the other parameters based on the UAM, which was defined as an inverse modeling. Because the significant parameters such as hydrate saturation have been considered as independent variables in the model, we can effectively avoid the correlation between QC and the others. Prediction multiplicity can be reduced. The estimated QC was consistent with the drilling and geological understanding in the field application, indicating that the method proposed is effective and practical. © 2020, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Gas hydrate; Gas saturation; Quartz content; Rock physics; Seismic inversion; Shenhu"

But for unmanned aerial manipulator(UAM), this is still a challenging task. In order to solve the problem of accurate grasping in a large-scale area, we propose a novel detection and control framework for UAM, which consists of two stages: preliminary localization and precise localization. At the preliminary localization stage, the RGB-D sensor mounted on the end-effector of the manipulator scans to obtain the point cloud surrounding the UAM. By bringing the known target shape and processed point cloud parameters into our proposed loss function, we select the highest priority area as the best potential region proposal, which can help the UAM to screen out the target for precise localization from the obtained point cloud. At precise localization stage, after UAM reaches the best potential region, the RGB-D sensor mounted on the drone uses the deep object pose estimation(DOPE) to estimate the 6D pose of the target. Through independently compensating for the disturbance of the UAV and manipulator, the UAM can accurately grasp the target with the estimated 6D pose. To evaluate the performance of the UAM, we conducted experiments in four different scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that the UAM can grasp the target with an average success rate of 83.4% for the large-scale scene. The above results prove the feasibility and robustness of the framework. The code is available at https://github.com/skywoodsz/CatchIt. © 2020 IEEE.",

Therefore, airspace classifications and structures need to evolve based on appropriate performance metrics, while new models and tools are needed to address UTM operational requirements, with an increasing focus on the coexistence of manned and unmanned Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles and associated Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) infrastructure. This paper presents a novel airspace model for UTM adopting Performance-Based Operation (PBO) criteria, and specifically addressing urban airspace requirements. In particular, a novel airspace discretisation methodology is introduced, which allows dynamic management of airspace resources based on navigation and surveillance performance. Additionally, an airspace sectorisation methodology is developed balancing the trade-off between communication overhead and computational complexity of trajectory planning and re-planning. Two simulation case studies are conducted: over the skyline and below the skyline in Melbourne central business district, utilising Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). The results confirm that the proposed airspace sectorisation methodology promotes operational safety and efficiency and enhances the UTM operators’ situational awareness under dense traffic conditions introducing a new effective 3D airspace visualisation scheme, which is suitable both for mission planning and pre-tactical UTM operations. Additionally, the proposed performance-based methodology can accommodate the diversity of infrastructure and vehicle performance requirements currently envisaged in the UTM context. This facilitates the adoption of this methodology for low-level airspace integration of UAS (which may differ significantly in terms of their avionics CNS capabilities) and set foundations for future work on tactical online UTM operations. © 2020 by the authors.

A flapping mechanism is proposed to transform a powered shaft rotation to an optimal kinematics of wing motion combining up-and-down stroke, pitching, and fore-and-back swing. An unsteady aerodynamic method (UAM) was developed based on potential flow theory, including the leading- and trailing-edge vortices generated by a flapping wing. After validation based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results, the method is used to calculate the aerodynamic forces of flapping wings. The flight dynamics model of the aircraft is built using Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) software version 2012 interfacing with the UAM coded in Python. The coupling between the inertial force of the body motion and the aerodynamic forces from flapping wings and tailplane is incorporated into the numerical simulation of the aircraft landing. Taking a 0.196-kg birdlike aircraft model with a prescribed kinematics of flapping wing motion as an example, a parametric study was carried out in a small range of initial tailplane angles and subsequent flapping frequencies. Optimal parameters were obtained to reduce the forward and descending velocities of the aircraft to a minimum value for safe and short landing performance. The study is then extended to aircraft of different geometric scales in a range of 0.5-10 associated with a weight scale of 0.1-1,000. Based on the study, a method is developed to determine the required flapping frequency for birdlike aircraft of different scales to achieve a short landing target with the descending velocity reduced to a specified value. For the aforementioned example aircraft (geometric scale of 1), the flapping frequency is 4 Hz to reduce both descending and forward velocities to 50% of the landing performance in fixed-wing mode, while a birdlike aircraft on a geometric scale of 10 and landing weight of 196 kg requires a minimum flapping frequency of 1.25 Hz to achieve a 50% reduction of the descending and forward velocities compared with the same aircraft landing in fixed-wing mode. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Descending velocity; Flapping wing; Short landing; Unsteady aerodynamic method"

Currently, available aviation design assurance methods using safety assurance standards are not suited for regulatory assurance of autonomous systems Aviation is facing enormous growth in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) technology. The challenge for applicants and regulators is to assure system safety of autonomous systems. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions. This paper explores whether the aviation industry can apply those solutions to UAS and UAM assurance. ANSI/UL 4600, Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products, is the first and only publicly available autonomous safety standard. This standard is backed by a certified non-profit standards organization, Underwriters Laboratories. This standard has been recognized as an international American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved standard. The goal-based, technology neutral features of ANSI/UL 4600 make it adaptable to other industries and applications. It assures safety through monitoring safety performance, which enables the desired aviation regulatory approach. It reflects stakeholder views from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who have contemplated the product liability for the design and manufacturing challenges associated with these new technologies. The applicability to the aviation industry can be understood in terms of these features: • Goal-Based and Technology Neutral: ANSI/UL 4600 does not require a specific design approach or specific technology. The applicant company must present an auditable and defensible evidence-based safety case. Those central features of safety and auditability follow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliance philosophy and could be adapted to aviation. • Continued Airworthiness with Monitored Safety Metrics: The FAA's desire to move to performance-based standards with risk-based strategy is supported by ANSI/UL 4600. Further, ANSI/UL 4600 recognizes that continued safety is even more important than one-time initial approval/acceptance, especially for learning systems used in problem-solving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Functional transformations of learning systems are continuously monitored by OEMs. Continued airworthiness could be assessed using this method even though the system is presumably fielded with unknown risks due to new and novel technology. • Modernization of Regulatory Approaches: This methodology supports performance-based regulations with compliance required to enforce system-of-systems interoperability. Applicants could design and test appropriate to their technology while regulators can audit and check for safety case completeness. Over time, industry can standardize some portions of testing as the technology matures. Different standards and codified standard approaches could also be independently designed and adapted as technology becomes standardized across the industry. Aviation regulators are already on this path to make performance-based regulations where applicants have the choice of technology and standards that can support innovation. • Industry and Public Stakeholder Engagement: The standard has undergone industry and public scrutiny in the automobile segment with considered reviews from technical, legal, and actuarial perspectives. The FAA and The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) have been working to implement a safety case umbrella that encompasses all facets of UAS and UAM development, operation, and maintenance. The safety case umbrella is a systems approach to combine specific UAS and UAM nuances as they relate to current regulatory structure. While the approach affords a performance-based and risk-based oversight of aircraft design and development, production, maintenance and operation, the current regulations were not written to address AI and specifically machine learning. Even when those advanced techniques are not used, small UASs often use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology and technology of unknown pedigree could also be assured by the regulators using that approach. The codified approach of ANSI/UL 4600 could be superimposed on the safety case umbrella approach based on current regulations. The exercise of creating an auditable safety case also increases applicant safety awareness and safety culture. For approval of UAS and UAM, this paper recommends a structured and practical framework with an evidence-based safety case, which also takes into consideration the current regulations for applicability to UAS and UAM safety. © 2020 IEEE.","AI; Autonomous Systems; Certification; Complexity; Goal-based Regulatory Oversight; Machine Learning; Risk Metrics; Safety Case; UAM; UAS"

The highest lipid content and productivity of 60% glipids gDCW−1 and 85 mg L−1 d−1, respectively, were obtained when controlled acidification to pH of 5.5 was applied after 80 h of operation under N-depletion. The strategy was also applied successfully in a larger scale using different configurations such as bubble-column photobioreactors and raceway ponds, operated outdoors, yielding a maximum lipid content of 45% glipids gDCW−1 in both systems. Globally, the lipid content increased almost twice the value obtained without acidification in indoor and outdoor conditions.

However, tunneling at shallow depth in soft grounds gives rise to concerns associated with tunnel instability. Umbrella arch method (UAM), as a pre-reinforcement approach of tunnels in complex geological conditions, is widely used to maintain the tunnel stability. Quantitative assessment of the impacts of the entire approach and forepoling pipe features on tunnel stability remains challenging due to the complex nature of the UAM application. This study aimed to assess the effect of pipe design parameters on reinforcing the tunnels excavated in soft grounds. This practical investigation considered the actual field conditions attributed to the tunneling procedure and UAM deployment. Then, the tunneling process was modeled and the tunnel excavation-induced settlements were calculated. The post-processed results confirmed that deploying the UAM substantially reduced the tunnel crown and ground surface settlements by 76% and 42%, respectively. Investigation of various design parameters of pipes underscored the significance of incorporating the optimum value for each individual parameter into design schemes to more effectively control the settlements. Additionally, contrasting the settlement reduction rates (SRRs) for pipe design variables showed that the tunnel stability is more sensitive to the changes in the values of diameter and length, compared to values of the installation angle and center-to-center distance of the pipes. © 2020 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Finite element analysis; Forepoling pipes; Numerical simulation; Tunnel reinforcement; Umbrella arch method (UAM); Urban tunneling"

During the earthquake, 77 buildings suffered partial or total collapse and more than 8,000 buildings experienced damage ranging from slight damage to significant structural damage necessitating demolition. As observed in previous earthquakes, the unique soil conditions of Mexico City resulted in extensive damage to the city's infrastructure, primarily due to local site effects. The earthquake caused relatively more damage to buildings built on transition and soft soil zones (i.e. between hard and deep soft soils) than those on hard soils. The NZSEE and UAM team focussed on areas with widespread and extensive damage. They also assessed the performance of repaired and retrofitted buildings after the 1985 Michoacán earthquake.

Travelers will likely be able to request on-demand, point-to-point transportation through air taxis in the not-to-distant future. Previous multimodal research efforts have focused on surface urban mobility, where multiple modes of ground transportation compete with and complement each other, ignoring the growing role that aviation will play going forward. Existing public transportation data exchange models, tailored for their respective systems, likewise, have not yet accounted for this looming transportation transformation nor for widespread multimodal end-to-end, seamless transporting. To date, the FAA has succeeded in establishing a robust data exchange architecture to support traditional air transportation, but to facilitate this evolution of the public airspace system with respect to UAM and other emerging air vehicle systems, new and revised data exchange models are necessary. Existing data exchange models in need of revision include the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) [2], [3]. New data exchange models in need of creation include the Passenger Information Exchange Model (PIXM), the Operation Information Exchange Model (OIXM), and Vehicle Information Exchange Model (VIXM) [1]. The research here explored these data models, identifying and defining preliminary conceptual data elements necessary to support seamless, end-to-end mobility. The conceptual model herein proposed is holistic and considers all modes of transportation - walk, car, bus, rail, boat, air, etc. - and looks to incorporate the most promising transportation data exchange models from among these transportation systems.A realistic multimodal travel scenario subject to disruptive events (such as severe weather) was developed for the purpose of identifying the necessary exchange of data to reduce the impact of the disruptive events on the traveler. This work helped inform the next steps in the project, the definition of multimodal data exchange models and the development of a corresponding multimodal transportation conceptual data model. The scenario includes Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles that are intended to serve as short haul providers operating in a congested urban metro environment to bypass surface traffic congestion. New aviation market entrants, such as UAM, will likely not operate entirely within a traditional gate to gate model and are eventually likely to use a model similar to on-demand surface transportation such as ride share. Uber Elevate has already been proposing this type of application for their future air taxis [4]. Accommodating these new aviation market entrants will require further extensions to the FIXM (a second package for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) is already planned by the FIXM committee), adoption and enhancement of existing industry data exchange models, and entirely new data models. GTFS is the industry-leading and international de facto public transportation data exchange standard and has an extension called flex for supporting on-demand mobility, though has been limited to surface applications thus far [3], [5]. Alongside FIXM and GTFS, new models are necessary to facilitate seamless, end-to-end mobility. Proposed models include the Vehicle Information Exchange Model (VIXM), the Passenger Information Exchange Model (PIXM), and the Operator Information Exchange Model (OIXM) [1].This paper serves as an initial exploration of a data exchange model for future of transportation. The authors envision a future where a traveler can easily plan, dynamically re-plan, and track the real-time progress of a multimodal trip from the convenience of a smartphone application.

Such capability is pushing the current communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) / air traffic management (ATM) systems that were not designed to support these types of aviation scenarios.

A challenge to HEIs is to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to achieve Sustainable Development (SD), as they are important stakeholders. In order for a person to take responsibility for a sustainable future, it is not only important to implement SDs in higher education, but to follow the progress of the individuals' awareness of the sustainable world and lifestyle. This study aimed to analyze students of Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM), focusing on their attitudes, behaviors, and level of knowledge concerning education for sustainable development (ESD), to better understand the situation of students in terms of learning and applying sustainability. The students' perception of the University practices and initiatives, as well as pedagogical methodologies for promoting and learning SD, were also examined. An online survey was applied to undergraduate students from several faculties at UAM, and a sample of 504 students returned from a total population of 30,000 students. Descriptive and inferential analyses were carried out and included Chi-square tests, correlation analyses, and ANOVA analyses for independent and repeated measures. The results reveal good levels for the three dimensions (global Index > 3.5), with consistency demonstrating the highest correlation between attitudes and behaviors, although differences between faculties were identified. Knowledge has the highest score among all faculties. In addition, the results point to a need to better communicate the initiatives promoted, as well as to realign some learning methodologies with students' preferences. The most important contributions of the paper are as follows: Shedding fresh light on the knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral dispositions of university students and improving strategies concerning education in higher education institutions. Furthermore, it is relevant to say that UAM has pushed sustainability in environmental management and education, so it is also important to assess the impact of these initiatives. Our research aimed to help understand how students incorporate sustainability into their attitudes and behaviors, and whether this incorporation depends on the type of faculty. It also makes it possible to verify whether the sustainability measures implemented by universities are identified and applied by their students. © 2020 by the authors.","Education for sustainability; Higher education institutions; Learning methodologies; Scientific areas; Students attitudes; Students behaviors; Students knowledge"

Ultrasound can be an alternative to accelerate this process. The objective of this work was to determine if ultrasound is able to accelerate EVOO aromatization with rosemary and basil and how it affects the migration of volatile and other compounds, the oxidative stability and the antioxidant capacity of the aromatized products. Ultrasound parameters (amplitude, time, and temperature of extraction) were optimized for each herb with central composite designs. Free fatty acid, peroxide value, K232, K270, ΔK, fatty acid profile, total phenolics, antioxidant capacity, polar compounds, oxidative stability and volatile compounds profile were evaluated in all samples. Physical effects of ultrasound on the herbs were observed by scanning electron microscopy. In the optimization, variables related to the oxidative processes were minimized and compounds migration and oxidative stability were maximized. Results were 70.09% amplitude, 36.6 min and 35 °C for rosemary and 95.98% amplitude, 9.9 min and 30 °C for basil. These conditions were compared to 7 and 15 days of conventional maceration (CM). Aromatization of EVOO with rosemary, both by ultrasound assisted maceration (UAM) or CM, improved total phenolics, terpenes, esters, ketones, stability and induction times, as well as decreased the values for the quality parameters. The use of UAM accelerated the process to 37 min. However, aromatization with basil by CM increased the values for the quality parameters and reduced the total phenolics, the antioxidant capacity and the induction and stability times. UAM with basil reached better results than those observed for CM, in only 10 min. In conclusion, rosemary is more appropriate than basil for EVOO aromatization, and UAM was the best choice to accelerate the processes when compared to CM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental designs; Gas chromatography; Green technologies; Mass spectrometry; Ocimum basilicum L.; Rancimat; Rosmarinus officinalis L."

Here we present our proposal for changes to the current algorithm for immune evaluation of potential kidney recipients in Poland based on the experience of various transplantation centers. The most important finding of this article is an algorithm that stratifies the pretransplant immunologic risk based on strict laboratory criteria, enabling harmonization between transplant centers in Poland. This is because of a step-by-step algorithm for alloantibody assessment using solid-phase assays (SPA) and clearly defined technical issues, as well as cutoffs for reporting UAMs. Our novel approach focuses on a laboratory testing extension in the scope of HLA typing; detection and characterization of alloantibodies before transplantation; desensitization; and post-transplant monitoring. The proposed changes will allow for the assessment of clinically relevant anti-HLA antibodies with complement binding properties; the determination of UAMs in the potential donor; the calculation of virtual panel reactive antibodies (vPRA); the calculation of the recipient's immunologic rejection risk stratification; the assessment of the donor-recipient virtual cross-match (vXM); and the determination of the final recipient's selection for the biological cross-match testing.

The received signal strength indicator is widely used for wireless distance estimation, because of its advantages, including availability, low cost, flexibility, and so on. As is well known, RSSI measurement values are extremely susceptible to the surroundings, resulting in uncertain distance estimations. Without confidential information, the distance estimation results could not provide valuable priori information for follow-up processing methods and applications, such as localization, navigation, and guidance. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty analysis method for RSSI-based distance estimation (UAM-RDE) to study the uncertainty propagation in RSSI-based distance estimations. In UAM-RDE, we explore the uncertainty propagation mechanism from the input to the output of the RSSI-based distance estimation, including uncertainty factor analysis, sensitivity analysis, propagation, and synthesis of uncertainty.

For each EAP concept, a conventional TMS is designed for two electric component technology levels: state of the art and advanced. The goals for the paper are to compare the TMS designs for the above EAP concepts, to study how changes in requirements affect the TMS subcomponents, and to develop generalized TMS sizing relations. Each conventional TMS concept utilizes a liquid-based cooling methodology and is designed to cool the EAP electrical components only. The design parameters considered in this study include TMS architecture variation due to differing vehicle cooling requirements, electrical component efficiencies, vehicle total fuel burn or energy consumption, and electrical component operating temperatures. Results show that cooling components with low temperature limits increases TMS weight and demonstrate that efficiency gains of the specific technologies can net a lower weight TMS system despite more stringent temperature limits. © 2020 AIAA.",

Recent day, new air mobility called urban air mobility (UAM) is emerging driven by the rapid developments of drone, electrical power, IT and autonomous technologies. But to develop and settle down this new urban air mobility as a new urban public transportation, various technical, legal and public barriers should be solved. One of the most important key barriers of UAM is the environmental noise impact of UAM operation. This noise impact can limit the permission and operation fleet of UAM not exceeding land use compatibility. Ultimately the perception by observers can be understood for community acceptance.

This demand-responsive nature of MoD poses a challenge for optimally scheduling vehicles, and it has attracted much attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of research in the MoD scheduling literature: a homogeneous fleet is assumed, but it is not necessarily true all the time. Hence, this article proposes a novel formulation of the scheduling problem for UAM with a heterogeneous fleet and presents particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm that utilize a greedy algorithm to keep solutions feasible. The proposed algorithms are implemented with a model-predictive control scheme to effectively manage the demand-responsive nature. As a result, the proposed algorithms can find a near-optimal solution in a short time. Using the algorithms, a numerical experiment with six different fleet mixes is conducted, and impacts of fleet heterogeneity are analyzed. As a result, it is shown that the fleet heterogeneity affects both the quality of service and operational efficiency, and there is a tradeoff: the more vehicles and seats, the better the service, but the less efficient it is. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm (GA); mixed-integer linear programming; mobility on demand (MoD); model-predictive control (MPC); optimal scheduling; particle swarm optimization; urban air mobility (UAM)"

This ambitious benchmark aims to determine the uncertainty in LWR systems and processes in all stages of calculation, with emphasis on multi-physics (coupled) and multi-scale simulations. Specifically, in this work, a simplified BWR core is used to propagate the uncertainty of nuclear data. Due to a high computational cost in the analysis all fuel assemblies are modeled as fresh. The propagation is subdivided into two levels i) assembly level –with SCALE6.2.1 and SAMPLER module–, and ii) core level, –with PARCSv3.2 and DAKOTA 6.3–. The first level takes into account the uncertainties contained in the master library ENDF/B-VII.1 and as a result a problem-dependent neutronic library in NEMTAB format is obtained using TXT2NTAB code. This is a friendly Matlab code developed within this work. Finally, the uncertainty contained in the neutronic library is further propagated through PARCS. A different approach is presented in this work to propagate the uncertainty between codes. Following this approach only two neutronic libraries are generated, one with the average responses and the other with their standard deviations. Then, the standard deviation and a matrix of perturbation factors are used to perturb the main neutronic parameters.

The difference in the covariance data between JENDL-4.0 and ENDF/B-VII.1 was discussed by comparing the influence of nuclide/reaction covariance data.

However, such a system would require more training data for every specific user, thus hindering its applicability for real-world scenarios. Collecting training data can be time consuming and expensive. For example, in clinical applications it can take weeks or months until enough data is collected to start training machine learning models. End users expect to start receiving quality feedback from a given system as soon as possible without having to rely on time consuming calibration and training procedures.

Our UAM are trained using deep transfer learning and data augmentation and were tested on two public datasets. The first one is an activity recognition dataset from accelerometer data.

The time-dependent standard deviation curve follows the time-dependent mean power curve and the relative standard deviation, in a percentage of the mean power, increases with the mean power peak value. We found, too, that the first-group diffusion coefficient and the first-group absorption cross section are, practically, the only contributors to the total power peak variance.

Such austere environments exist in battlefield medicine, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and in areas struck by natural disasters. Whether in military operations or civilian settings, the Universal Anesthesia Machine (UAM) (Gradian Health Systems, New York, New York) is a draw-over device capable of providing safe and effective general anesthesia when external oxygen supplies or reliable electrical sources are limited. This brief report discusses a proof-of-concept observational study demonstrating the clinical utility of the UAM in a resource-limited area. Materials and Methods: This observational study of 20 patients in Haiti who underwent general anesthesia using the UAM highlights the device's capability to deliver anesthesia intraoperatively in a resource-limited LMIC clinical setting. Preoxygenation was achieved with the UAM's draw-over oxygen supply. Patients received acetaminophen for analgesia, dexmedetomidine for preinduction anesthesia, and succinylcholine for paralysis. After induction, the UAM provided a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. Manual ventilation was performed using draw-over bellows until spontaneous ventilation recurred, when clinically appropriate, artificial airways were removed. Intraoperative medication was administered at the anesthesiologist's discretion. The institutional review board at the U.S. anesthesiologists' affiliated institution and the Haitian hospital approved this study; patients were consented in their native language. Results: Two anesthesiologists used the UAM to deliver general anesthesia to 20 patients in a Haitian hospital without access to an external oxygen supply, reliable power grid, or opioids. The patients' average age was ~40 years, and 90% of them were male. Most of the cases were herniorrhaphy (50%) and hydrocelectomy (25%) surgeries. The median American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 2; 45% of the patients had an ASA score of 1, and none had an ASA score >3. Of the 20 cases, 55% of patients received an endotracheal tube, and 40% received a laryngeal mask airway; for one patient, only a masked airway was used. Every patient was discharged on the day of the surgery. No complications occurred in the perioperative or 1-month follow-up period. Conclusion: The UAM can be used where a lack of resources and training exist because of its simple design, built-in oxygen concentrator, and capacity to revert from continuous-flow to draw-over anesthesia in the event of a power failure or if external oxygen supplies are unavailable. We believe the UAM addresses some of the shortcomings of modern anesthesia machines and has the potential to improve the delivery of safe general anesthesia in combat and austere scenarios. Further studies could consider different types of surgeries than those reported here and involve more complex patients. Studies involving alternative anesthetic agents and non-anesthesiologist personnel are also needed. Overall, this brief report detailing the use of the UAM following a natural disaster in a LMIC is proof of concept that the machine can provide reliable anesthesia for surgical procedures in austere and resource-limited environments, including disaster areas and modern combat zones. © 2019 The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

Even though various methods have been applied for UM analysis, to date there is no standardized method for comprehensive accounting of material flows in urban systems. Moreover, the accounting of material flows is rarely implemented with a bottom-up approach that can provide a thorough analysis of UM. This article presents the Urban Accounting Model (UAM) which aims to allow comprehensive accounting of urban material flows based on a bottom-up approach. The model comprises two interlinked sub-models. The first was developed by integrating a new physical input output table (PIOT) framework for urban systems into a three-dimensional structure. The second comprises a set of physical accounts for systematic accounting of material flows of each economic sector in the system in order to support the compilation of the PIOTs. The functions of the UAM were explored through its application to two urban neighborhoods in the Stockholm Royal Seaport district. The application highlighted that the UAM can describe the physical interactions between the urban system and the environment or other socioeconomic systems, and capture the intersectoral flows within the system. Moreover, its accounts provide information that allow an in-depth analysis of the metabolism of specific sectors. Overall, the UAM can function as a useful tool for UM analysis as it systematizes data collection and at the same time depicts the physical reality of the urban system. © 2019 by Yale University","bottom-up; industrial ecology; material flow analysis; physical input output table; Stockholm Royal Seaport; urban metabolism"

Secondly, an experimental model of the flapping wing aircraft has been built and tested to measure the motion and aerodynamic forces produced by the flapping wing. Thirdly, aerodynamic analysis is carried out based on the measured motion of the flapping wing model using an unsteady aerodynamic model (UAM) and validated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The difference of the average lift force between the UAM and CFD method is 1.3%, and the difference between the UAM and experimental results is 18%. In addition, a parametric study is carried out by employing the UAM method to analyze the effect of variations of the pitching angle on the aerodynamic lift and drag forces.

As several urban air mobility (UAM) concepts are conceivable, all relevant physical effects as well as mutual interrelations of the UAM system have to be addressed and evaluated at a sufficient level of fidelity before implementation. Therefore, a collaborative system of systems modeling approach for UAM is presented. To quickly identify physical effects and cross-disciplinary influences of UAM, a pool of low-fidelity physical analysis components is developed and integrated into the Remote Component Environment (RCE) workflow engine. This includes, i. a., the disciplines of demand forecast, trajectory, vertiport, and cost modeling as well as air traffic flow and capacity management. The definition and clarification of technical interfaces require intensive cooperation between specialists with different areas of expertise. To reduce this communication effort, the Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema (CPACS) is adapted and used as central data exchange format. The UAM system module is initially applied for a 24-hour simulation of three generic networks in Hamburg City. After understanding the basic system-level behavior, higher level analysis components and feedback loops must be integrated in the UAM system module for evaluation and optimization of explicit operating concepts. © 2020 by the authors.","Collaborative design; Conflict detection; Cost and revenue modeling; Demand modeling; Flight scheduling; Route optimization; System of systems; Trajectory simulation; Urban air mobility; Vertiport modeling"

The most interesting feature of flying cars is the expected opportunity they could offer to reduce congestion, traffic jams and the loss of time to move between origin/destination pairs in urban contexts. In this perspective, urban air mobility might meet the concept of ""sustainable mobility"", intended as the ideal model of a transport system that minimizes the environmental impacts by maximizing efficiency and travel speed. For transport engineering planning issues, further knowledge is required in this field to understand the effects that a possible urban air mobility system, including the ground traffic component, could have in terms of sustainable mobility in the above meaning. This paper contributes to this topic by providing an analysis of different urban flying car scenarios by using an agent-based approach with different traffic conditions. The preliminary results obtained on some test networks and focusing on travel cost effects suggest that the expected advantages the flying car will depend on trip origin/destination points, average distances travelled in the urban contexts and the location of transition nodes, which are introduced as interchange nodes between aerial and ground mode. © 2020 by the authors.","Flying cars; Software agents; Traffic management; Transportation network; Urban air mobility (UAM)"

Insertion of steel pipes at the periphery of the tunnel and infiltration of grouts along the pipes into the rock masses increases tunnel stability. There are two major effects of grouts expected at the tunnel face: 1) increase of face stability by enhancing the frictional resistance of discontinuities and 2) decrease of permeability along the rock masses. Increase of resistance and decrease of permeability requires a certain curing time for the grout. In Korea, we require 24 hours for curing of grout, which means no progress of excavation for 24 hours after infiltration of grouts. This step delays the tunnel construction sequences. To eliminate such inefficiency, we propose MTG (Method for Tunnel construction using Grouting technology), which uses extended length of steel pipes (14 m) compared to conventional pipe roof method (12 m). The merit of MTG is the reduction of curing time. Because of the approximately 2 m extension of the length of steel pipe, blasting can be done after infiltration of grouting. For this paper, we conducted experiments on the shear strength behaviors of grout infilled rock joint with elapsing of curing time and blasting induced vibration. The results show that blasting induced vibration under MTG does not influence the mechanical features of grout material, which indicates no influence on the mechanical behaviors of grout, contributing to the stability of tunnels during excavation. This result indicates that MTG is a cost effective and fast construction method for tunneling in Korea. © 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Grouting; Method for tunnel construction using grouting technology (MTG); Tunnel reinforcement; Umbrella arch method (UAM)"

The method employs weak-signal correlation techniques and long measurement intervals to achieve a 1 km range. Low-cost radar is an enabling technology for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft envisioned for large-scale deployment in urban areas. These aircraft must be autonomously piloted to make them economically feasible, but autonomous systems have yet to match a human pilot's ability to detect and avoid (DAA) obstacles. Visible light cameras are useful for this application, but cameras alone are insufficient, as they are fundamentally unable to resolve range. Existing commercial radar units would suffice for DAA, but their large size weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) militates against their application to UAM. The technique detailed in this paper is a fused camera-radar solution that exploits the camera's excellent angular resolution to guide radar signal processing so that signals arriving from a camera-detected target are combined constructively. Such guided processing significantly extends the range of low SWaP-C radar chipsets, making them useful for DAA. An analysis of the fused technique's robustness to target velocity uncertainty is presented, along with experimental results indicating that a typically-sized VTOL aircraft would be detectable at a range of 1 km. © 2020 IEEE.",

It is hoped that UAM will help meet today's political targets of sustainability and decarbonization. However, there are certain threats that could impede the sustainable and thus successful introduction of UAM to our cities, with noise being a prominent limitation. This paper argues that citizens have to be viewed as stakeholders in urban air transportation, regardless of whether they or not intend to use it, and that a concept of resident participatory noise sensing (PNS) will be beneficial to the implementation of UAM.

The relative uncertainties of the eigenvalues, two-group constants and burnup-related parameters have been quantified and compared, quantifying the uncertainty differences of covariance data in ENDF/B-VII.1 and ENDF/B-VIII.0. Through analysis, the conclusions can be given that more reliable, not smaller nuclear-data covariance data can be provided in ENDF/B-VIII.0. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Covariance comparisons; ENDF/B-VII.1; ENDF/B-VIII.0; Uncertainty analysis"

The UAM framework also includes other urban Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) services that will be supported by a mix of onboard, ground, piloted, and autonomous operations. Over the past few years UAM research has gained wide interest from companies and federal agencies as an on-demand innovative transportation option that can help reduce traffic congestion and pollution as well as increase mobility in metropolitan areas. The concepts of UAM/UAS operation in the National Airspace System (NAS) remains an active area of research to ensure safe and efficient operations. With new developments in smart vehicle design and infrastructure for air traffic management, there is a need for methods to integrate and test various components of the UAM framework. In this work, we report on the development of a virtual reality (VR) testbed using the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) technology for human-automation teaming and airspace operation research of UAM. Using a four-wall projection system with motion capture, the CAVE provides an immersive virtual environment with real-time full body tracking capability. We created a virtual environment consisting of San Francisco city and a vertical take-off-and-landing passenger aircraft that can fly between a downtown location and the San Francisco International Airport. The aircraft can be operated autonomously or manually by a single pilot who maneuvers the aircraft using a flight control joystick. The interior of the aircraft includes a virtual cockpit display with vehicle heading, location, and speed information. The system can record simulation events and flight data for post-processing. The system parameters are customizable for different flight scenarios; hence, the CAVE VR testbed provides a flexible method for development and evaluation of UAM framework. © 2020 IEEE.",

For example, near earth relays are looking to transition from the traditional few large geostationary satellites to satellite constellations consisting of thousands of small low earth orbiting satellites while lunar space communications will require the need to relay data from many assets distributed on the lunar surface back to earth. Furthermore, within the aeronautics realm, satellite communications for beyond line of sight (BLOS) links are being investigated in tandem with the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) within the urban air mobility (UAM) environment.

The energy-dependent sensitivity coefficients are produced by the sensitivity analysis using the 3-D fine flux and adjoint flux based on the first-order perturbation theory. Not only can the sensitivity coefficients be used to estimate the uncertainty of the effective multiplication factor caused by the measurement uncertainties of nuclear cross-section data, but also they can be implemented in the cross-section adjustment according to the Bayes’ theorem and the generalized linear-least-squares method (GLLSM).

Some of these youth end up in a court mandated compulsory-care institution within months upon their arrival. A key concern is the appropriateness of UAMs ending up in an institutional care system which is aimed at youth with significant criminal justice, violence and/or drug problems. A second concern is that UAMs in compulsory care may display behavioral and acting out behaviors while in care due to their history of trauma and confusion regarding being institutionalized. The research question examined is whether UAMs in compulsory care receive more restrictive actions by compulsory care staff compared to their counterparts who are non-UAMs. Materials and methods: The research team used national compulsory-care registry data from 2014-2016 to compare a range of restrictive actions taken by institution staff between UAMs versus non-UAMs while in care. Differences in the rate of compulsory care restrictive actions reported between UAMs and non-UAMs, while in care, were examined using chi-square test and Poisson regression methods. Results: A total of 2398 children and youth were placed in compulsory institutional care during the study period, of whom 423 (17.5%) were unaccompanied. The Poisson regression model identified that being subjected to body search, limited body inspection, drug use testing, and care in locked unit were used significantly less often for UAMs individuals compared to non-AUMs. In addition, repeated number of intakes in compulsory care and number of dropouts were lower among UAMs during this time period. Conclusion: The finding of this national registry study revealed that restrictive actions by institutional staff within compulsory care were significantly less common for UAMs versus non-UAMs. This study roughly suggests that the Swedish policy makers overseeing NSBIC need to consider and evaluate other care alternatives for UAMs, in addition to youth compulsory institutional care. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Compulsory care; Restrictive action; Sweden; Unaccompanied minor"

However, despite a growing interest in UAM, understanding users’ perceptions to it remains limited. This research aims to identify and quantify the factors affecting the adoption and use of UAM, based on relevant tools from the literature, such as recurring factors in studies on aerial vehicle concepts, ground autonomous vehicles, but also acceptance models, such as the Technology Acceptance Model by Davis et al. (1989). A stated-preference survey was developed to assess the perception of users in terms of adoption time horizon, including options such as the first six years of the service's implementation, “unsure”, and “never”. The obtained results were evaluated using exploratory factor analyses, and the specification and estimation of suitable discrete choice models, multinomial logit models (MNLs) and ordered logit models (OLMs), with adoption time horizon as dependent variable. Findings revealed the importance of safety and trust, affinity to automation, data concerns, social attitude, and socio-demographics for adoption. Factors, such as the value of time savings, the perception of automation costs, and service reliability, were also found to be highly influential. There was also an indication that skeptical respondents, i.e. answering “unsure”, had a behavior similar to late and non-adopters, i.e. adoption time horizon higher than six years or answering “never”.

In this paper, a novel UAM airspace design concept has been proposed to separate arrival air traffic of wingless EVTOL aircraft from winged EVTOL aircraft until merging at the metering fix. Two separate vertiport arrival procedures have also been proposed for the problem based on anticipated UAM traffic density in emergent (low) and early expanded (moderate/high) operations, as proposed by NASA. The objective of the problem is to minimize the makespan (landing completion time) of a given set of EVTOL aircraft. A heuristic approach called insertion and local search combined with two different scheduling methods called 1) mixed-integer linear programming and 2) time advance are proposed to minimize the makespan of the mixed fleet of EVTOL aircraft. Next, the impact of the number of landing pads N on the makespan is studied to aid in early expanded UAM operations. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to see the impact of the following on the sequencing and scheduling algorithms: 1) the number of EVTOL aircraft expected to land n and 2) the number of EVTOL aircraft used in the local neighborhood search k. Through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis, our algorithms demonstrated real-time scheduling capabilities; therefore, they can be potentially used for on-demand UAM arrival operations. © 2020, AIAA International.

The considered case studied a full PWR core behavior in fast (~0.1 sec) rod ejection transient. According to the benchmark, the core represented a Hot Zero Power state. Authors used brute-force sampling propagating nuclear data and thermo-fluid uncertainties using 3D computational IRSN chain HEMERA. It couples the reactor physics code CRONOS and thermal-hydraulic core code FLICA4. The nuclear data uncertainties were represented in a form of cross sections standard deviations (in percentage of the mean cross sections values) supplied by the UAM team. In addition to the original benchmark, the study includes a case with an increased power peak by supplementary rod ejection, i.e. with higher reactivity. Both the results are similar to what we obtained in the mini-core rod ejection: the power standard deviation follows, in percentage of the mean power, the mean power curve. We split the variance with a direct calculation: once the cross sections are modified and the thermal-hydraulics inputs are kept constant, another time the contrary. The results show that uncertainties dues to nuclear data dominate over ones due to the thermal-flow area. Furthermore, the major contributors in peak-of-power variance lie in a fast group of cross sections. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

A key source of uncertainty in fast reactor calculations arises from the underlying nuclear data. Addressing the propagation of such uncertainties through multiphysics calculations schemes is therefore of importance, and is being addressed through international projects such as the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling (SFR-UAM) benchmark. In this paper, a methodology for propagation of nuclear data uncertainties within WIMS is presented. Uncertainties on key reactor physics parameters are calculated for selected SFR-UAM benchmark exercises, with good agreement with previous results. A methodology for coupled neutronic-thermal-hydraulic calculations within WIMS is developed, where thermal feedback is introduced to the neutronic solution through coupling with the ARTHUR subchannel code within WIMS and applied to steady-state analysis of the Horizon 2020 ESFR-SMART project reference core. Finally, integration of reactor physics and fuel performance calculations is demonstrated through linking of the WIMS reactor physics code to the TRAFIC fast reactor fuel performance code, through a Fortran-C-Python (FCP) interface. Given the 3D multiphysics calculation methodology, thermal-hydraulic and fuel performance uncertainties can ultimately be sampled alongside the nuclear data uncertainties. Together, these developments are therefore an important step towards enabling propagation of uncertainties through high fidelity, multiphysics SFR calculations and hence facilitate BEPU methodologies. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

However, to determine the revolutionary character of electric flight we have to compare it to aircrafts driven by fossil fuels with respect to their technical abilities. Technical properties determining potential application fields are assumed to be maximum range and maximum speed (travel time). To identify application fields and the competition within we, first, collected the technical properties of 197 vehicles of type personal aerial vehicle (PAV), helicopter, small aircraft transportation system (SAT) and business jets, and second, apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) using range and maximum speed. Electrical propulsion techniques are found to fall into the low range clusters and electrical and hybrid technologies dominate the very short ranges reaching up to 200 km. Though, helicopters are active in these ranges and superior regarding number of passengers plus maximum speed, they cannot compete with PAVs regarding costs, and even more important, environmental sustainability. In addition, the states of development of PAVs competing to helicopters with regard to range are still in scaled prototype or in concept phase. Thus, our findings underline the run for urban air mobility (UAM) as an application of electric propulsion techniques due to short ranges at slow speeds and the possibility of decreasing the environmental impact of mobility. Moreover, we cannot identify any competition of the new PAV technologies with classical aerial vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

The users dictate trip origin, destination and timing. One of the major components of this vision is urban air mobility (UAM) for the masses. UAM means a safe and efficient system for vehicles to move passengers and cargo within a city. In order to reach UAM’s full market potential the vehicle will have to be autonomous. One of the primary challenges of autonomous flight is dealing with off-nominal events, both common and unforeseen; thus, intelligent contingency management (ICM) is one of the enabling technologies. In this context, the vehicle has to be aware of its internal state and external environment at all times, ascertain its capability and make decisions about mission completion or modification. All of these functions require data to model and assess the environment and then take actions based on these models. Necessarily, there is uncertainty associated with the data and the models generated from it. Since we are dealing with safety-critical systems, one of the main challenges of ICM is to generate sufficient data and to minimize its uncertainty to enable practical and safe decision making. We propose an overall architecture that incorporates deterministic and learning algorithm together to assess vehicle capabilities, project these into the future and make decision on mission management level.

These designs are based on the assumption that the stability and control of recreation or basic utility-sized drones can be scaled to larger passenger-sized vehicles. Previous work had shown the challenges in stabilizing passenger-sized quadcopters. In this study, power constraints were made less restrictive and varied, allowing more control power. Motor parameters such as efficiency, nominal voltage and current operating point, and rise time of the rotor speed controller step response were studied. By fixing the efficiency of the motor to 95% and assuming a motor voltage to current ratio of 2.0 (previously, assumed to be 1.0), the authors were able to stabilize the quadcopter in the roll axis because this allowed the vehicle to achieve adequate rise times between 0.4 and 0.8 s. This motor optimization was extended to a hexacopter and octocopter designed to the same payload size and mission as the quadcopter. The three vehicle configurations and their motor speed controllers were compared. It was found that while hexacopter and octocopter required more mass and overall power; all three configurations had similar margins required for control. However, the hexacopter and octocopter were able to use this power margin to achieve lower rise times (i.e. the vehicle responded more quickly to pilot inputs) than the quadcopter, with the octocopter having the lowest rotor response rise time of the three vehicle configurations studied. © 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.",

This paper discusses wind-tunnel testing of a full-scale, UAM multirotor size, fixed-pitch, rigid rotor with a focus on vibratory blade loads and on the ability to predict these loads with comprehensive analysis. Test results show that vibratory loads are very high, with peak-to-peak magnitudes up to three times greater than the steady component.

The CFD and acoustics simulations are carried out using the HPCMP CREATETM-AV rotorcraft simulation and analysis tool Helios and the acoustic prediction tool PSU-WOPWOP. The influence of the finest wake-grid spacing size on acoustic prediction of the side-by-side rotor with 0% overlap is studied based on two wake-grid spacing cases: 5% Ctip and 10% Ctip. No significant difference in overall sound pressure level (OASPL) is found between the two cases. The effect of rotor overlap on rotor acoustics is also assessed, and it is shown that the 25% overlap case yields higher OASPL than the other overlap cases particularly due to stronger rotor-to-rotor blade-vortex interactions (BVIs). Furthermore, the noise of the side-by-side rotor with 0% and 25% overlaps is compared against similar-sized helicopter noise and various background noise levels. It is shown that the side-by-side rotor noise is comparable with the noise of a similar-sized four-bladed helicopter in cruise. The OASPL difference of the overhead case is less than 10 dB, which does not meet the guideline that the UAM noise should be 15 dB lower than similar-sized helicopter noise. The results also show that the side-by-side rotor noise could not be fully masked by the freeway background noise at an altitude of 1,500 ft. Thus, noise reduction technology should be developed to overcome the barrier of public acceptance of UAM noise. © 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.",

This paper presents a study of this new market using a parametric approach that accounts for the performance of Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, takeoff and landing infrastructure (vertiports), and the demand for ridership given a ticket price and time saved. One of the key mode choice drivers in switching from existing transportation options to an AAM service is the value gained in saving time, which is also tightly correlated with people's income level. The analysis framework can facilitate market feasibility analysis by considering various scenarios and constraints. The results suggest that near-term profitability is possible even though vertiport throughput capacities are limited by existing footprint and operational constraints. Vertiport expansion can increase throughput and demand up to a point of maximum aircraft utilization. This new limit is due in part to ground turnaround time and battery charging requirements. Improvement in battery charging rates or implementing battery swap strategies could dramatically improve profitability while maximizing vehicle utilization. As operations increase to hundreds of flights at certain vertiports, local airspace congestion and aircraft vertiport mobility become the next bottleneck. © 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.",

Electric propulsion and power system performance is also important. To better understand how electric propulsion and power systems component performance influences overall vehicle design, a sensitivity assessment was performed noting changes in vehicle gross weight and energy usage. Updated versions of the Revolutionary Vertical lift Technology (RVLT) Project vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) urban air mobility (UAM) reference vehicles and missions were used. NASA electric vehicle studies are discussed which were used to help select the range of electric propulsion and power system performance parameters used in this assessment. Thermal management systems (TMS) considerations are also important; new and innovative power management and distribution (PMAD) systems can reduce electric system weight and losses, reducing thermal management constraints often imposed by electric systems modest maximum use temperatures. Vehicles with higher disk loadings require higher power levels per unit weight for VTOL operations, which make them more sensitive to electric system weights and efficiencies. Battery, all-electric vehicles show different sensitivities to component performance than turboelectric or hybrids systems. Battery, all-electric propulsion systems may increase vehicle weight and size, but still results in lower mission energy usage than their hydrocarbon-fueled versions. Significant vehicle weight growth to electric propulsion and power system power-to-weight reductions also occurs at different levels among the various concepts.

The different elements of the taxonomy are separated using a higher level of abstraction in a way that the general description of the tasks are considered and not its operational details. To illustrate the fact that algorithms must adapt to different tasks, a description of the usual UAM architecture is carried out. Four categories of criteria are used in the taxonomy to differentiate all possible tasks. These categories are the interaction type, the actual task definition, the environment condition and the time sensitivity of the task.

Based on demonstrated technology, the aircraft uses a turboshaft engine with a sound-absorbing installation, and the NOTAR anti-torque system to eliminate tail-rotor noise, consequently the noise and annoyance of the aircraft are dominated by the main rotor. Several design parameters are explored to reduce the noise, including rotor tip speed, blade geometry, and higher-harmonic control. Commensurate with the level of design detail, the noise is calculated for compact loading and thickness sources on the rotating blades. The metric is the reduction of the noise for the helicopter certification conditions (takeoff, flyover, and approach), relative a baseline aircraft with typical (high) tip speed, conventional blade planform, and no higher-harmonic control.

A total of three CFD models is simulated: 1-passenger isolated rotor configuration, 1-passenger full configuration, 6-passenger isolated rotor configuration. The noise comparison between the 1-passenger isolated rotor and full configurations shows that the vehicle fuselage can increase the A-weighted sound pressure level (SPL) up to 5 dB. An acoustic comparison between the 1-passenger and 6-passenger configurations suggests that the maximum difference in overall SPL between the two configuration is 14 dB. Furthermore, it is shown that the noise of 1-passenger and 6-passenger configurations is significantly lower than that of a four-bladed conventional helicopter in level flight. However, there is still a challenge to meet the community noise acceptance level so that further noise reduction is recommended.

The results show that the 1-passenger vehicle noise can be fully masked by the highway noise at an altitude greater or equal to 1,000 ft while the 6-passenger vehicle noise can only be partially covered by the ambient noise.

We show that so long as the ecosystem design parameters for ground infrastructure and fleet design fall within a sensible range, the performance of the UAM ecosystem is affected by the policies used to manage the UAM traffic. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Very different types of UAS are used for applications such as aerial photography, inspection, emergency and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), operating in low altitude and urban environment, as well as in high altitude airspace integrated with the conventional air transportation system. As a new airspace user, UAS brings novel safety challenges to the current aviation system. For current aviation the main safety issues concern first and second parties, i.e. lives and property of crew and passengers. In contrast, the main safety concern of UAS operations is third party risk (TPR), i.e. the risk posed to people and properties that have no responsibility for the UAS operation and neither benefit in some way from the UAS operation. In order to ensure the safe operation of UAS, there is a need for an evaluation of safety regulation developments for UAS operations against relevant TPR indicators. The aim of this paper is to identify relevant TPR indicators for UAS operations and to evaluate safety regulations against these TPR indicators. The main finding is that current UAS safety regulations do not consider the accumulation of TPR contributions from many UAS flights per annum over rural or urban populations. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A process was developed to integrate UAM vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft into the fixed-wing ATG modeling environment without significant change to the underlying equations of motion and vehicle model database. The VTOL aircraft models were converted from a six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) representation into a four degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) representation for integration within ATG. Three vehicle designs from the NASA Revolutionary Vertical-Lift Technologies (RVLT) project were selected: a lift-plus-cruise (LPC) aircraft model and quadrotor, electric-powered (QEP) 1-seater and 6-seater models. With the LPC model comprised of a nonlinear force and moment build-up, and the QEP models comprised of linearized stability derivatives, two separate processes were developed to convert the lift, drag, and propulsion characteristics of each model into the ATG model database. Key aircraft performance characteristics including climb, cruise, and descent performance were preserved during the conversion process. Because ATG simulates fixed-wing aircraft through ground taxi and takeoff to approach and landing, acceleration command algorithms were developed to model the vertical takeoff and vertical landing phase of UAM operations. A strategy was then developed to transition the aircraft model to-and from-the new control mode. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.",

A big challenge associated with the introduction of these new operations is ensuring that the complex system-of-systems responsible for these operations known as Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) meet the high safety standards of aviation. In this work, we present a general purpose framework for validating decision making systems, protocols, and algorithms that may exist in the UTM ecosystem. We propose a novel, simulation driven approach for validation in UTM that can automatically discover the failure modes of a decision making system, and optimize the parameters that configure the system to improve its performance. We apply this approach to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and package delivery use cases, and examine in detail the failure modes and the potential improvements of two UTM services critical for strategic deconfliction: trajectory planning and optimal scheduling. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to discover failure modes in the system that would be challenging for humans to find and fix, and we show how the algorithm can learn from these failure modes to improve the performance of the UTM services in question. We also demonstrate the significant sample efficiency improvements that our algorithm has over naive stress testing approaches that rely on uniform sampling. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The scheduler models each vertiport by the number of vertipads and parking spaces, and manages reservations on timelines for those vertiport resources, at a level of fidelity suitable for fast-time and system-level analyses of UAM concepts and other airspace studies. The paper defines the theoretical model that can be used to estimate the capacity of various vertiport configurations. The theoretical model provides an understanding of the conditions that can lead to either a parking space-limited or a vertipad-limited vertiport. Examples of potential throughput for some vertiport configurations are provided using both a queueing approach as well as a simulated UAM demand scenario. The study demonstrated that a first-come, first-served scheduling approach can have inefficiencies in the use of the vertiport resources. The inefficiencies can increase as the number of resources increases. Nonetheless, 80% or better peak throughput to capacity ratio was observed for most vertiport configurations. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In the context of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), for a company providing aerial ridesharing services, the cost of electric energy it consumes from the power grid will be the dominating cost factor. Unlike fuel, the electricity market is highly dynamic in terms of pricing and incentives. It often provides considerable amount of monetary compensation for consumers to help balance generation and load in the power system. In this work, we develop an optimal fleet dispatch framework for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to transport passengers and provide power grid services either separately or together. In addition to vehicle dispatching, the framework can also optimally price passenger trips taking place at different routes at different times. The eVTOL vehicle fleet operations was subjected to two sources of uncertainties, which are the pricing/incentive stochasticity from the dynamic electricity market, and the passenger demand uncertainty due to the stochastic trip requests. We investigate the trade-off among multiple revenue and cost sources for eVTOL fleet operations. The major objectives of this work include: (1) maximizing the first revenue source generated from transporting passengers; (2) maximizing the second revenue source generated from providing frequency regulation services to the power grid; and (3) reducing the operating and charging costs. The major benefits of this work include: (1) maximizing the revenue from eVTOL fleet operation, which will result in a more profitable aerial ride sharing company; (2) lowering the riding cost for passengers, which will make the aerial ride sharing more affordable to customers; and (3) enhancing the reliability and stability of modern smart grid. The results demonstrate that UAM carriers can earn more profit by dispatching the eVTOL fleet to provide both UAM travel and power grid services simultaneously than providing only one of the services. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Early adoption of urban air mobility (UAM) using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft could be shuttle-like service between downtown and airports, given that timely arrival to airports are more critical than many other purposes of roadway trips. Such UAM operations require that vertiports are located on or near airports. VTOLs routes arriving at and departing from vertiports will need to carefully designed to support the sharing of terminal airspace without causing any safety concerns. Using a combination of geographical information system tools and trajectory planning algorithms, this research seeks to evaluate the feasibility of Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) trajectories in the airport area and examine potential vertiport locations within or near the terminal environment. Present operations at one major airport were modeled to create a baseline of current manned operations. A Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm was employed to design minimum cost VTOL trajectories that stay a specified distance from current manned operations, terrain features, and obstacles.

Intermediate-sized two- and four-passenger (400- and 800-lb payload) designs formed the final candidate configurations. All aircraft were equipped with electric motors for propulsion, but different variants were configured with variable pitch (collective) control (with constant rotor speed) or variable rotor speed control (with constant pitch). Flight dynamics models developed had sufficient richness of detail to conduct flight control or handling qualities assessments. Based on the various modeling assumptions, assessments showed that collective control was feasible, whereas rotor speed-based control exhibited unstable closed-loop roll and pitch dynamics.

One of many challenges however is determining when and where it is safe to operate in an urban environment, where complex microscale weather conditions created by channeled winds and turbulent eddies induced by buildings may transform otherwise benign conditions into hazards. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model considered highly capable for supporting urban UAS / UAM weather needs is the Joint Outdoor-indoor Urban Large Eddy Simulation (JOULES) model, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-enabled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that can simulate horizontal and vertical winds and turbulence in urban domains down to 0.3 m (1 foot) resolution. MITRE and Aeris have begun examining how the JOULES model could be applied for mission-specific UAS and UAM weather hazard impact planning given a range of envisioned operations in urban environments. This paper presents the results from a novel methodology for comprehensive validation of LES-modeled estimates for microscale (2 m) horizontal and vertical wind conditions perturbed by buildings in a realistic urban environment. The validation directly compares the LES data with Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI)-examined water tank fluid flow conditions within the same, scaled urban environment (Oklahoma City, OK: OKC). Validation results demonstrated that overall, across the different domains and specific flow comparison locations (including customized UAM climb and descent trajectories and UAS urban playbook flight paths), the JOULES model performed well in matching varied (and at times complex), time-averaged horizontal and vertical wind magnitude and direction. Validation results suggest that JOULES is well-suited to support urban microscale weather hazard planning and decision support for future UAS and UAM operations. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This humble beginning is like the DVDs-by-mail launch for a future Netflix type industry transformation. On the way to on demand electric mobility, the UAM industry has to grow and evolve its UAM services, including dispatch and flight monitoring services. The City-wide Air Mobility Evaluation and Operations System (CAMEOS) was created to allow an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operational dispatcher to plan and rehearse a flight virtually and check for issues before filing a flight plan. CAMEOS was designed to serve a UAM operator offering air taxi services using a fleet of vehicles that take-off and descend vertically and fly according to a flight plan within a defined urban environment with urban and near-urban destinations. Given that the urban climate is largely unknown and there is a lack of detailed, real-time, widespread, accurate forecasts, particular attention will need to be paid to battery levels during flight, and from flight to flight, by the flight dispatcher. The dispatcher will not plan a flight that is likely to enter a state of insufficient battery. CAMEOS checks the flight plan against the available battery to ensure the flight can be completed successfully. The dispatcher can create and visualize flight plans in CAMEOS, rehearse the flight plan, and then send the flight plan to the vehicle using CAMEOS connections to the flight deck. Once underway, the dispatcher can monitor the flight, as well as all other flights in the fleet, in the CAMEOS terminal window. In order to design this flight planning, flight deconfliction, and flight monitoring service, we had to assume a network of vertiports in a dense US urban area, create flight rules, and design approach paths, and create a notional performance profile for urban air vehicles.

Unmanned vehicles require a communications system to provide command and control to insure safe operations. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been researching the Command and Control (C2) portion of NASA’s Integration of Unmanned Aerial Systems in the National Airspace System (UAS in the NAS) since 2011. GRC’s UAS C2 research encompasses simulations and analysis, laboratory examination, and test flights of a Control non-Payload Command (CNPC) radio designed specifically for UAS operations. This work is in support of the RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC-228) to develop a UAS C2 Minimum Operational Performance Standard (MOPS). The radio is a joint developmental effort between GRC and Collins Radio. The long term UAM vision is for pilotless, fully autonomous vehicles; in other words, UAVs. However, until the autonomy technologies mature to the level of safe operations, the UAM vehicles will take an evolutionary path to full autonomy. The first step, or phase, is likely to be an expert pilot on-board. As experience with UAM is gained and technology improves, a second phase with a skilled pilot might begin. Here again, as experience and technology improvements occur, a third phase, the one with a Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) may be initiated. Because GRC’s mandate is UAVs, the UAM work has concentrated on the RPIC phase. A Concept of Operations (ConOps) was developed from which a set of C2 seed requirements were deduced and translated into criteria for assessing wireless technologies meanwhile identifying missing regulations. Additionally, UAM C2 simulations are being carried out and lab, ground, and air tests for Long Term Evolution (LTE), 4G wireless, systems are being examined as one possible wireless communications solution in the urban environment.

To date, most research is focusing on independent factors regarding the supply and demand of UAM, such as vehicle types and infrastructure capacity. We propose a simulation framework that facilitates analyzing the potential demand of UAM, using a combination of interacting factors. We define five scenarios, ranging from representations of niche application up to mass transport options, by varying fleet size, available technologies, infrastructure placement and pricing strategies. These scenarios are fed into an extended version of the agent-based transport simulation platform MATSim, chained with the microscopic transportation orchestrator (MITO). The simulation results show that the system configuration has a big impact on UAM demand, infrastructure capacity and fleet size were identified as main bottlenecks. We see high levels of demand during peak hours and for trips up to 20 km, however, none of the scenarios results in a sufficiently high modal share of UAM that manages to reduce traffic volumes substantially, and with that congestion, of ground-based modes.

Low specific energy of onboard lithium-ion polymer batteries and wind conditions impose constraints on flight endurance. Therefore, from the safety and efficiency perspective, planning and flying minimum energy trajectories are important. The primary motivation for this paper is to determine if there is an operational benefit to flying wind-optimal trajectories for short flights (less than 60 miles) in the urban environment. This study employs wind-optimal trajectories for a NASA-proposed conceptual multirotor aircraft flight in the urban environment. The optimal control model presented includes a wind model for quantifying the effect of wind on the trajectory. The optimal control problem is numerically solved using the direct method. Energy consumption and flight duration flying wind-optimal trajectories between origins and destinations in a metropolitan area are compared with energy consumption and flight duration flying on the great-circle paths between the same origin and destination pairs to determine the operational benefit of wind-optimal routing for short flights. The flight duration results for different scenarios are validated using a simulation tool designed and developed by NASA for exploring advanced air traffic management concepts. In summary, this research study suggests that for short flights in an urban environment, the wind-optimal trajectories have a very slight (insignificant) operational advantage over the great-circle trajectories in terms of energy consumption and flight duration.

The unknown parameters of the models were identified through mean square regressions applied on the real data available for the case-study.

We perform an FHA and an STPA on an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle undergoing an urban air mobility (UAM) passenger carrying reference scenario and present excerpts of this analysis. We then draw parallels between the techniques and highlight elements where they naturally reinforce to each other’s results, specifically in the consideration of hazard severity with respect to flight phases, the design of hazard mitigations, and the applicability of the results to all types of regulatory approvals (e.g., type certification, operational approval, and crew training). © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In addition, the focus has been placed on developing autonomous vehicles for intra-city short haul flights using vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft in effort to facilitate NASA’s new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) program. This requires precise knowledge of the current health state of the entire vehicle, and the ability to estimate and predict the state of health over time to make these short missions robust and safe. Online estimation methodologies that reason about faults and component degradation are critical to the safety of the aircraft, its occupants, and the success of its mission. More importantly, it is necessary to understand how degradation at the component level affect the performance of the overall system. We hypothesize that utilizing a holistic approach to system health management will result in a robust framework which can be applied to a number of safety-critical systems.

One of the concepts currently being studied and developed are eVTOL (electrical vertical takeoff and landing) vehicles. This paper discusses a nonlinear dynamic inversion based control law that was designed for this vehicle concept. Two advantageous inherent properties of dynamic inversion in this setup are the effective decoupling of the control axes which are by design highly coupled for this kind of vehicle, and its ability to naturally handle changes of operating condition, which removes the need for gain scheduling. These are advantageous for control of VTOL vehicles, due to their wide range of operating conditions which varies from hover to forward flight, and transitioning between them. The inner dynamic inversion control loop, including an optimization based blended control allocation strategy to the rotors as well as to the control surfaces, serves as an inner core flight control system for the full envelope. This setup is complemented with a set of linear controllers, and reference models as well as command filtering for the different manual control modes in the various flight phases. An autoflight mode is included as well. By using Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion, it was found that the overall controller becomes significantly less dependent on accurate aircraft model properties, especially with respect to the aerodynamic derivatives, of which one can expect limited knowledge for this kind of UAM vehicles. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, before any of these vehicles see commercial flight they must be certified by the civil aviation authorities. The Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency in Europe are currently in the process of developing appropriate certification procedures. Instead of only focusing on creating new certification requirements, both agencies are currently looking into the option of adjusting present certifications for light aircraft. In particular, the FAA considers adjusting the Part 23 airworthiness standards with special conditions to allow for certification of eVTOL Urban Air Mobility vehicles (UAM). One of the hurdles prohibiting the use of Part 23 for certification of eVTOL vehicles is proper thrust and energy management. It must be ensured at all times that the vehicle has sufficient energy stored in its batteries to perform critical flight maneuvers and that this information is continuously communicated to the pilot or a control system. If the estimate of the power required to maintain a flight state or the energy required to safely complete a maneuver exceeds the available reserves, the pilot must be warned and provided with a suggested plan of actions. In addition, the aviation authorities need tools to verify statements made by the aircraft manufacturers pertaining to achievable flight performance, range and safety margins, in order to assist them in the flight safety assessment and airworthiness certification process. The purpose of the model presented in this paper is to serve as first-principle model capable of calculating power and energy requirements for variety of electric eVTOL vehicle designs operating in user-specified conditions. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Motivation for this technology results from demand for experimental efficiency and model fidelity that has increased with growing aircraft complexity and aerodynamic nonlinearities. These issues are typical in the responses presented by a class of vehicles categorized as Urban Air Mobility aircraft where many features from both airplane and rotorcraft are present. For UAM configurations, with typically many more factors than conventional aircraft, traditional test methods can lead to increased costs and missed interactions. RAM guides the test to obtain high-fidelity, statistically rigorous aircraft models, and the approach is applicable to computational, ground, or flight-test experiments. It combines concepts from Design of Experiment theory and Aircraft System Identification theory that allow the user the freedom to choose, in advance of the test, a specific level of fidelity typically, in terms of prediction error. RAM only collects data required to meet the user-specified fidelity and fidelity is only limited by the facility and test article capabilities.

This system primarily uses passive optical and acoustic sensors along with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems), or GPS (Global Positioning System) and ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast). The system design, known as Drone Net, is a network of passive sensors designed to cover a kilometer square area. In this paper we present the results of experiments to add an active RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) on the ground and active LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) on flight nodes (small UAS). System tests completed previously have shown feasibility for all passive optical and acoustic UTM and UAM. The point of the RADAR testing is to directly compare passive sensor networks to active to determine the value of each alone and to test the hypothesis that multi-modal active and passive sensing will be superior, but likely at higher cost than passive alone. Previously, we completed coordinated experiments with an EO/IR camera system and acoustic sensor network with an All-sky hemispherical six-camera system with resolution up to 12 million pixels to optimize detection and tracking. For some applications such as corporate campuses and Class-D airports, passive sensing alone might be sufficient and most cost effective, but for urban, military, and higher traffic Class-C and Class-B larger airports, we believe the combined multi-modal purpose-built sUAS RADAR integrated with optical and acoustic sensor networks will be most effective. Based upon our preliminary results presented herein, purpose built small RADAR with wide fields of view configured into an All-sky active system along with optical All-sky cameras and acoustic sensors are ideal for urban locations requiring the highest confidence in monitoring of combined UTM, UAM and GA (General Aviation) traffic. UTM will mostly be small UAS delivering parcels and must share airspace with UAM carrying passengers for short-hop transportation along with general aviation covering longer distances, but also entering urban airspace at airports. Clearly the airspace in urban locations is going to become much more congested, with new risk, but also new opportunity to improve transportation overall. The results we present here are a start at answering basic questions about multi-modal sensor effectiveness for urban navigation, both passive and active. In scenarios where sUAS and UAM may not have reliable GNSS or might not be UTM compliant, the ground detection, tracking and localization is most critical for assured urban airspace safety and security. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

There are many different configurations of UAM vehicles, but they generally use an electric motor driving a propeller or ducted fan powered by batteries or a hybrid electric power generation system. Transmission cables are used to move energy from the storage or generation system to the electric motors. Though terrestrial power transmission cables are well established technology, aviation applications bring a whole host of new design challenges that are not typical considerations in terrestrial applications. Aircraft power transmission cable designs must compromise between resistance-per-length, weight-per-length, volume constraints, and other essential qualities. In this paper we use a multidisciplinary design optimization to explore the sensitivity of these qualities to a representative tiltwing turboelectric UAM aircraft concept. This is performed by coupling propulsion and thermal models for a given mission criteria. Results presented indicate that decreasing cable weight at the expense of increasing cable volume or cooling demand is effective at minimizing maximum takeoff weight (MTO).

The Best-Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) methodologies have been developed and implemented within the framework of the LWR UAM benchmark to provide a realistic predictive simulation capability without compromising the safety margins. This paper describes the current status of the methodological development, assessment, and integration of the BEPU methodology to facilitate the multiscale, multiphysics LWR core analysis. The comparative analysis of the results in the stand-alone multiscale neutronics phase (Phase I) is first reported for understanding the general trend of the uncertainty of core parameters due to the nuclear data uncertainty. It was found that the predicted uncertainty of the system eigenvalue is highly dependent on the choice of the covariance libraries used in the UQ process and is less sensitive to the solution method, nuclear data library, and UQ method. High-to-Low (Hi2Lo) model information approaches for multiscale M&S are introduced for the core single physics phase (Phase II). In this phase, the other physics (fuel and moderator), providing feedback to neutronics M&S in a LWR core, and time-dependent phenomena are considered. Phase II is focused on uncertainty propagation in single physics models which are components of the LWR core coupled multiphysics calculations. The paper discusses the link and interactions between Phase II to the multiphysics core and system phase (Phase III), that is, the link between uncertainty propagation in single physics on local scale and multiphysics uncertainty propagation on the core scale. Particularly, the consistency in uncertainty assessment between higher-fidelity models implemented in fuel performance codes and the rather simplified models implemented in thermal-hydraulics codes, to be used for coupling with neutronics in Phase III is presented. Similarly, the uncertainty quantification on thermal-hydraulic models is established on a relatively small scale, while these results will be used in Phase III at the core scale, sometimes with different codes or models. Lastly, the up-to-date UQ method for the coupled multiphysics core calculation in Phase III is presented, focusing on the core equilibrium cycle depletion calculation with associated uncertainties. © 2020 Jason Hou et al.",

Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level-k model in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment.

Noise from RPAS can be very distinct, with tonal qualities that sensitive individuals can find particularly annoying. This is an issue faced both within Australia and worldwide. In 2018, the Australian Government's Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development (the Department) provided approval to a commercial operator to perform a trial of drone deliveries of food and household items at specific locations in the south of Canberra. In 2019, the delivery services were approved for four northern Canberra suburbs and two suburbs in South Brisbane. The trial in south Canberra in 2018 had mixed reviews from the community and prompted the need to implement quieter drone technologies in an urban environment. A review of noise regulations has been initiated by the Department that addresses both RPAS and the new concept of urban air mobility (UAM) systems. This paper explores the existing regulatory framework in Australia and discusses appropriate noise certification standards and noise metrics.

And, there are a large number of malicious nodes in the network. These malicious nodes may tamper with the correct data and pass them to other nodes. The normal nodes will use the wrong data for information dissemination due to a lack of ability to verify the correctness of the messages received, resulting in the dissemination of false information on medical, social, and other networks. Auditing user attributes and behavior information to identify malicious user nodes is an important way to secure networks. In response to the user nodes audit problem, a user audit model based on attribute measurement and similarity measurement (AM-SM-UAM) is proposed. Firstly, the user attribute measurement algorithm is constructed, using a hierarchical decision model to construct a judgment matrix to analyze user attribute data. Secondly, the blog similarity measurement algorithm is constructed, evaluating the similarity of blog posts published by different users based on the improved Levenshtein distance. Finally, a user audit model based on a security degree is built, and malicious users are defined by security thresholds. Experimental results show that this model can comprehensively analyze the attribute and behavior data of users and have more accurate and stable performance in the practical application of the network platforms. © 2020 Xiaohui Yang and Ying Sun.",

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency has been developing an international benchmark of the light water reactor (LWR) uncertainty analysis in modeling (UAM) for the examination of uncertainty quantification and propagation methodologies with various modeling and simulation code systems. The objective of the present work is to develop an uncertainty propagation mechanism based on the stochastic sampling method by taking into account the uncertainties of both basic nuclear data and fuel modeling parameters in the simulation of pressurized water reactors (PWRs) that can be incorporated in the conventional LWR simulation approach. More specifically, the Three Mile Island Unit 1–related exercises from the LWR-UAM benchmark have been modeled using the coupled TRACE/PARCS code system in the three-dimensional core representation. The input uncertainties of the neutronics simulation include few-group cross sections and kinetics parameters generated using the Sampler/Polaris sequence of SCALE 6.2.1. Several heat transfer–related variables for the fuel modeling were considered as sources of input uncertainty of the thermal-hydraulics simulations, including the thermal conductivity of fuel and cladding, fuel heat capacity, and the gap conductance. Dakota was used to sample input parameters of the coupled code system and to perform the uncertainty analysis. Two types of simulations were conducted: steady-state calculation at hot full-power condition and transient scenario initiated by the spatially asymmetric rod ejection accident. Quantities of interest for the steady-state calculation, including core multiplication factor and power peaking factors, were calculated with associated uncertainties. For transient calculations, best-estimate plus uncertainty results of the time evolution of core reactivity, core power, and peak fuel temperature were generated and analyzed. The Wilks’ formula was used to determine the necessary sample size to achieve a 95% confidence of the 95% limit of output quantities of interest. Although the uncertainty propagation and quantification method presented in this paper was developed for PWRs, it could be in general applicable to the multiphysics uncertainty quantification of other types of LWR cores. © 2019, © 2019 American Nuclear Society.","multiphysics simulation; PWR; rod ejection accident; stochastic sampling; Uncertainty quantification"

The MIDAS project, funded in the frame of the Clean Sky 2 program, aims to satisfy those recent requirements with an ADS certified for commercial applications. The main pillar lays on a smart fusion between COTS solutions and analytical sensors (patented technology) for the identification of the aerodynamic angles. The identification involves both flight dynamic relationships and data-driven state observer(s) based on neural techniques, which are deterministic once the training is completed. As this project will bring analytical sensors on board of civil aircraft as part of a redundant system for the very first time, design activities documented in this work have a particular focus on airworthiness certification aspects. At this maturity level, simulated data are used, real flight test data will be used in the next stages. Data collection is described both for the training and test aspects. Training maneuvers are defined aiming to excite all dynamic modes, whereas test maneuvers are collected aiming to validate results independently from the training set and all autopilot configurations. Results demonstrate that an alternate solution is possible enabling significant savings in terms of computational effort and lines of codes but they show, at the same time, that a better training strategy may be beneficial to cope with the new neural network architecture. © 2019 by the authors.

These are serious global health disparities which threaten access to care and patient safety for those who receive surgical care. In this study, we conducted a simulation-based human factors analysis of the Universal Anaesthesia Machine (UAM®), a device designed to support anesthesia providers in austere medical settings. Our team anticipated the introduction of the UAM® to the two major referral hospitals in Freetown, Sierra Leone. A prior observational study had identified these two hospitals as having environmental conditions consistent with an austere environment: an unstable electrical grid, as well as limited access to compressed oxygen, biomedical support, and consumables. Although the Baltimore simulation environment cannot reproduce all of the challenges present in a resource-constrained environment such as Sierra Leone, the major impediments to standard anesthesia machine functionality and human factors-associated use can be reproduced with the use of high-fidelity simulation. Using anesthesia care providers who have limited UAM® familiarity, this study allowed for the examination of machine-user issues in a controlled environment in preparation for further field studies concerning equipment introduction, training and device deployment in Sierra Leone. The goals of this study were: 1. to assess the usability of the UAM® (machine-user interface, simulated patient use, symbology, etc.) across different provider user groups during simulation of use in scenarios depicting routine use in healthy patients, use in clinically challenging patients and use in environmentally-challenging scenarios in a controlled setting devoid of patient risk, and 2. To gather feedback on available UAM manuals and cognitive aides and UAM usability issues in order to guide development of curricula for training providers on use of the UAM® in the intended austere clinical environments. Methods: Residents, fellows, attending physician anesthesiologists, student nurse anesthetists, and nurse anesthetists participated in a variety of simulations involving the Universal Anaesthesia Machine® at the Johns Hopkins Medicine Simulation Center between September 2012 and July 2013. Data collected included participant demographics, performance during simulation scenarios captured with critical action checklists, workload ratings captured with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and participant reactions to UAM® use captured through a post-session survey and semi-structured usability debriefing. The scenarios were: 1. normal use (machine check, induction, and maintenance of an uneventful case), 2. use in a challenging clinical condition (acute onset of bronchospasm) and 3.use in an adverse environmental event (power failure). Critical action checklists and workload ratings were analyzed by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to control for participant demographics. Usability debriefings were analyzed qualitatively. Results: Thirty-five anesthesia providers participated in the study. Overall participant ratings, observations of performance in simulation scenarios, and usability debriefings indicated a high level of usability for the UAM®. Mean participant ratings were high for ease of use (5.4 ± 0.96) and clarity of instruction (6.2 ± 0.87) on a 7-point scale in which higher ratings indicate more positive perceptions. After adjusting for clinical experience, workload ratings were significantly higher in the bronchospasm scenario than in the normal/routine use (P = 0.046; 95% CI, 0.33–34.7) or power failure scenarios (P = 0.012; 95% CI, 5.24–37.9). Thirty-two specific usability issues were identified and grouped into five themes: device design and labeling, machine use during simulation scenarios, user-anticipated errors or hazards, curriculum issues, and overall impressions of the UAM®. Conclusions: The UAM® design addresses many of the key challenges facing anesthesia providers in resource-constrained settings. The simulation-based human factors evaluation described here successfully identified opportunities for continued refinement of the initial device design as well as issues to be addressed in future curricula and cognitive aides. © 2019 National Medical Association","Africa; Anesthesia; Global health; Human factors; Simulation training"

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA).

The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research. © 2019 IEEE.","ADS-B; fail-safe; fail-secure; GPS; UAM; UAS; UTM"

As Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are being developed, we need new encounter models that are representative of their operational environment. Developing such models is challenging due to the lack of data on UAM behavior in the airspace. While previous encounter models for other aircraft types rely on large datasets to produce realistic trajectories, this paper presents an approach to encounter modeling that instead relies on expert knowledge. In particular, recent advances in preference-based learning are extended to tune an encounter model from expert preferences. The model takes the form of a stochastic policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the reward function is learned from pairwise queries of a domain expert. We evaluate the performance of two querying methods that seek to maximize the information obtained from each query. Ultimately, we demonstrate a method for generating realistic encounter trajectories with only a few minutes of an expert's time. © 2019 IEEE.",

Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offer new possibilities for Urban Air Mobility (UAM). However, these developments will create operational issues and safety concerns, especially in the socalled transition period when these aircraft are expected to be manned by pilots, and assisted by onboard automation systems. In this transition period, different aircraft will have different systems for flying. Additionally, the type of flight control used during take-off and landing will often be different from the type of control used en route. In contrast to pilots on large commercial aircraft, eVTOL pilots will have available greater levels of automation, but will also incur greater variability in the type and scope of human control. How will this interaction between pilots and automation impact the safety of flight, especially in cases where the automation systems fail, and the pilot must assume full control?

UAM is an aviation industry term for passenger or cargo-carrying air transportation services, which are often automated, operating in an urban/city environment. UAM-style vehicles are expected to use vertical takeoff and landing with fixed wing cruise flight. Metrosim is a metroplex-wide route and airport planning tool that can also be used in standalone mode as a simulation tool. The scenarios described and reported in this paper were used to evaluate a fleet noise prediction capability for this tool. The work was a collaborative effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Intelligent Automation, Inc (IAI), and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). One scenario was designed to represent an expanded air-taxi operation from existing helipads around Manhattan to the major New York airports. The other case represented a farther term vision case with commuters using personal air vehicles to hub location just outside New York, with an air-taxi service running frequent connector trips to a few key locations inside Manhattan. For both scenarios, the trajectories created for the entire fleet were passed to the Aircraft Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to generate Day-Night Level (DNL) noise contours for inspection. Without data for actual UAM vehicles available, surrogate AEDT empirical Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) tables used a similar sized current day helicopter as the Baseline, and a version of that same data linearly scaled as the first guess at possible UAM noise data. Details are provided for each of the two scenario configurations, and the output noise contours are presented for the Baseline and reduced noise DNL cases. © 2019 IEEE.",

An interphase layer appears at the phase interface in the UAM-50 and the UAM-100 samples according to the data of differential scanning calorimetry. An exothermic effect appears in the calorimetry data curves for water-saturated samples in the temperature range of ΔT = 125–226°C with ΔH = 20.7 kJ/kg for the UAM-50 and 27.95 kJ/kg for the UAM-100; this indicates hydration of the polar groups of cellulose acetate and polyamide in the interphase layer of the composite films. When composite films in the air-dried and the water-saturated samples were studied with differential scanning, there was a redistribution of the ratio between the quantities of perfect crystalline structures in crystallites with different melting enthalpies. The melting enthalpy decreases from 6.06 to 0.99 kJ/kg for the MGA-95 low-temperature phase, from 1.99 to 1.72 kJ/kg for the high-temperature phase; from 3.04 to 1.38 kJ/kg for the UAM-50 low-temperature phase, from 8.12 to 1.76 kJ/kg for the high-temperature phase; from 4.99 to 1.5 kJ/kg for the UAM-100 low-temperature phase, and from 2.33 to 0.77 kJ/kg for the high-temperature phase. The total melting enthalpy of the endothermic peaks also decreases for all three samples; this is an indication of decreased crystallinity in the water-saturated samples of the composite films. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

This paper presents the development of turbocharger based mGTE and its integration with an electrical power pack. This mGTE is used for validating the concept of electro-mechanical interaction of these systems leading to electric power generation. The selection and sizing of the turbocharger center housing rotating assembly for the engine is carried out considering a wide range of industrial/consumer applications. All static parts including combustor have been designed and developed in view of the potential applications. The fuel-air mixture when burnt in the combustor expands across the turbine and exits through the exhaust nozzle to produce thrust. The energy in the exhaust gas is utilized for running the power turbine which in-turn is connected to an alternating current (AC) generator to produce electric power. A generator control unit that built in the alternator was used for voltage regulation. A control architecture has been designed to moderate the mGTE exhaust gas bypass valve in case of over-speeding of the alternator. Also, a resistor based variable load bank was designed to demonstrate generator performance. The system can be made to run on multiple fuels (for example, bio-gas, diesel or kerosene) with small changes to the combustion chamber. Few potential applications of the mGTE integrated power generator include decentralized power generation (microgrid), combined heating and cooling and laboratory platform for universities.

Lipofuscin derives, in part, from the incomplete degradation of phagocytized photoreceptor outer segments (OS). Whether this accumulated waste is toxic is unclear. We therefore investigated the effects of UAM in highly differentiated human fetal RPE (hfRPE) cultures. Methods: Unmodified and photo-oxidized OS were fed daily to confluent cultures of ARPE-19 RPE or hfRPE. The emission spectrum, composition, and morphology of resulting UAM were measured and compared to in vivo lipofuscin. Effects of UAM on multiple RPE phenotypes were assessed. Results: Compared to ARPE-19, hfRPE were markedly less susceptible to UAM buildup. Accumulated UAM in hfRPE initially resembled the morphology of lipofuscin from AMD eyes, but compacted and shifted spectrum over time to resemble lipofuscin from healthy aged human RPE. UAM accumulation mildly reduced transepithelial electrical resistance, ketogenesis, certain RPE differentiation markers, and phagocytosis efficiency, while inducing senescence and rare, focal pockets of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, it had no effects on mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, certain other RPE differentiation markers, secretion of drusen components or polarity markers, nor cell death. Conclusions: hfRPE demonstrates a remarkable resistance to UAM accumulation, suggesting mechanisms for efficient OS processing that may be lost in other RPE culture models. Furthermore, while UAM alters hfRPE phenotype, the effects are modest, consistent with conflicting reports in the literature on the toxicity of lipofuscin. Our results suggest that healthy RPE may adequately adapt to and tolerate lipofuscin accumulation.",

Exercise preceded or followed two daily meals by one hour, and the meals and exercise bouts were 7 hours apart. Fifteen subjects each performed two of five trials: No exercise (SED), uphill exercise before (UBM) or after meals (UAM), and downhill exercise before (DBM) or after meals (DAM). Relative to SED trial, osteogenic response, defined as the ratio of osteogenic C-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (CICP) over bone-resorptive C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX) markers, increased in exercise-after-meal trials, but not in exercise-before-meal trials. CICP/CTX response rose significantly after the first exercise-after-meal bout in DAM, and after the second one in UAM, due to a greater CICP rise, and not a decline in CTX.

These representations are high dimensional and require classification techniques for action recognition. In this paper, we propose a framework for unsupervised extraction of a discriminative low-dimensional representation called action-vector. To start with, local spatio-temporal features are utilized to capture the action attributes implicitly in a large Gaussian mixture model called the universal attribute model (UAM). To enhance the contribution of the significant attributes in each action clip, a maximum aposteriori adaptation of the UAM means is performed for each clip. This results in a concatenated mean vector called super action vector (SAV) for each action clip. However, the SAV is still high dimensional because of the presence of redundant attributes. Hence, we employ factor analysis to represent every SAV only in terms of the few important attributes contributing to the action clip. This leads to a low-dimensional representation called action-vector. This entire procedure requires no class labels and produces action-vectors that are distinct representations of each action irrespective of the inter-actor variability encountered in unconstrained videos. An evaluation on trimmed action datasets UCF101 and HMDB51 demonstrates the efficacy of action-vectors for action classification over state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we also show that action-vectors can adequately represent untrimmed videos from the THUMOS14 dataset and produce classification results comparable to existing techniques. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Action recognition; factor analysis; Gaussian mixture model; MAP adaptation; universal attribute model; unsupervised feature extraction"

In this paper, we make the first attempt towards visual feature translation to break through the barrier of using features across different visual search systems. To this end, we propose a Hybrid Auto-Encoder (HAE) to translate visual features, which learns a mapping by minimizing the translation and reconstruction errors. Based upon HAE, an Undirected Affinity Measurement (UAM) is further designed to quantify the affinity among different types of visual features. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several public datasets with sixteen different types of widely-used features in visual search systems.

The additional peak with the radii r3 = 6.18 Å and r3 = 6.44 Å with small coordination numbers in the water-saturated samples suggests that the interplanar space d (hk0) contains the atoms of the water molecules. It was found that water reduces the X-ray crystallinity by 26% in the UAM-50 sample and by 36% in UAM-100. According to the DSC data, an interfacial layer appears at the interface; the DSC curves of the water-saturated samples in the temperature range 125–226°C show an exothermal effect with ΔН = 20.7 kJ/kg for UAM-50 and ΔН = 27.95 kJ/kg for UAM-100, which indicates hydration of the polar groups of cellulose acetate and polyamide in the interfacial layer of the composite films. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","crystallinity; hydrogen bonds; interfacial layer; melting enthalpy; membrane; water"

In order to assess the performance of the methods that are available to evaluate such modes in nuclear systems, simple configurations that allow for an analytical solution are analysed, and the iteration processes of filtered power, of sub-space iteration and of implicitly restarted Arnoldi methods are compared and discussed. The drawbacks of the filtered power method are highlighted. The implicitly restarted Arnoldi and the sub-space iteration methods are then applied to two benchmarks, the C5G7 and the more realistic UAM configurations, in order to draw some practical indications on their performances.

The analysis was done from the pin-cell level to full core level to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the two-step neutronics calculation scheme. The responses analyzed contained the kinf, homogenized cross-sections, sodium void reactivity (SVR), Doppler constant (KD) and control rod worth (CRW) at the sub-assembly level, and the keff and power distribution at the full core level. The direct numerical perturbation method was used to get the relative sensitivity coefficients and the ‘Sandwich Rule’ was used to get the relative uncertainties. The results showed that the relative uncertainties propagated linearly from pin-cell to full core for the kinf and keff. Relative uncertainties of reactivity like SVR were much bigger than the ones of kinf and keff. However, the relative uncertainty of power distribution was smaller than other responses. Differences were observed in the S&amp;U analysis between the MOX fueled and metallic fueled SFRs. Softer spectrum of the large-size MOX fueled core caused bigger uncertainty compared to the metallic fueled core. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Metallic fuel; MOX fuel; Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis; Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor; Uncertainty propagation"

The management and separation of all these new aircraft has received much less attention, however, and even though NASA's lead is advancing some promising concepts for UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) Traffic Management (UTM), most operations today are limited to line of sight or airspace reservation and geofencing of individual flights. Various schemes have been proposed to control this new traffic, some modeled after conventional air traffic control and some proposing fully automatic management, either from a ground-based entity or carried out on board among the vehicles themselves. Previous work has examined the very low altitude airspace within a metroplex in which piloted traffic is very rare. A management scheme was proposed taking advantage of the homogeneous nature of the traffic. This paper expands the concept to include all altitudes desired for eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) urban and short, inter-city transportation. The interactions with piloted aircraft operating under both visual and instrument flight rules are analyzed, and the role of ATC provided services in the postulated mixed traffic environment is covered.

To investigate a novel strategy in constructing tissue-engineered corneal stromal equivalent based on amniotic membrane and keratocytes. METHODS. The ultrathin amniotic membrane (UAM) was laminated, with corneal stromal cells (CSCs) distributed between the space of the layered UAMs. Calcein AM staining was used to evaluate cellular viability, morphology, and arrangement. Immunostaining, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to detect gene and protein expression in keratocytes. Optical coherence tomography visualized the cross sections and thickness of the UAM construction. The microstructure of the CSC-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To evaluate the feasibility of the multilayer UAM-CSC lamination for surgery, the corneal substitute was used to perform lamellar keratoplasty. Slit lamp microscopy and corneal fluorescein staining were performed in postsurgery observation. RESULTS. The CSCs maintained their keratocyte phenotype and secreted well-organized ECM on the aligned UAM surface. The four-layer UAM-CSC lamination attained half thickness of the human cornea (250 ± 18 µm) after 8 weeks’ culture, which also showed promising optimal transparency. In TEM images, the CSC-generated ECM displayed stratified, multilayered lamellae with orthogonal fibril arrangement, which was similar to the human cornea microstructure. Furthermore, the stromal equivalent was successfully preformed in lamellar keratoplasty. Four weeks post surgery, the substitute was well integrated into the recipient cornea and completely epithelialized without myofibroblast differentiation. CONCLUSIONS. Our study established a novel 3D biomimetic corneal model to replicate the corneal stromal organization with multilayer UAM, which was capable of promoting the development of corneal stroma-like tissues in vitro, establishing a new avenue for basic research and therapeutic potential. © 2019 The Authors.","3D construct; Amniotic membrane; Corneal stroma; Lamellar keratoplasty; Tissue engineering"

The water crisis, energy deficit, global warming and profitability have generated the need of handsome debate on sustainable manufacturing in present scenario of industry 4.0. The technological development have raised the comfort level of living being with context to transportation, telecommunication and medical facilities as a result of processing harder grade materials utilizing conventional and modern machining operations. However, during processing of aforementioned materials the advanced level of process parameters require higher energy, consequently, resulted into elevated cutting temperature leading to poor product quality as well as uneconomical machining. Hence to lower the excessive cutting temperature the metal working fluids are utilized to absorb the heat evolved at different zones of machining operation. Consequently, the temperature get reduced, but raises the scarcity of negative effects such as skin rashes, itching, asthma, water pollution, soil pollution, mist generation and sometimes unprofitable conditions. So, to bridge the gap between the limitations of dry machining and conventional flood lubrication, the concept of minimum quantity lubrication has been exercised to achieve the challenges and goals of sustainable machining. In this papers, the sustainable machining aspects of minimum quantity lubrication has been while processing the titanium, Inconel, magnesium and other ferrous alloys which are widely used.

Attracted by the potentially large commuter and personal air travel market, companies such as Uber and Airbus are working towards launching their UAM services in near future. As the type of fleet deployed and the nature of operations in UAM are inherently different than ground-based transportation, new concepts and procedures are currently being developed to ensure safety and efficiency of such operations which will take place alongside traditional aviation. Additionally, new models of operations management are needed to support strategic and tactical decision making of the service providers, such as scheduling, dispatching and fleet planning, for maximizing their preferred objectives. Although such models will be critical to the success of the enterprise, no research, to the best of our knowledge, has yet been conducted on developing these models. Taking into account the unique set of operational constraints associated with UAM services, this paper proposes mathematical models for commercial transport service providers to decide which type of scheduling to offer, how to dispatch the fleet and schedule operations, based on simulated market demand, such that profit is maximized. The optimal fleet size can also be determined using the models. Three different settings of services – on-demand service, scheduled service, and a mix of both services (hybrid operations) – are modeled for carrying out a comparative analysis of the different forms of operations based on metrics such as fraction of total demand served and profit. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, despite research and testing, it is conceivable that when the UAM vehicles actually become operational, accidents will occur. Here in lies the problem; are accident investigators ready for UAM vehicle accidents? Historically, aviation accident investigations had been reactive and investigation outcomes provided recommendations, which paved the way for incremental safety improvements. Rules and procedures are in place to provide a feedback loop to lower the accident rate and maintain a safe aviation environment in its current form. To establish a UAM safety level, the installation and implementation of technical aids and procedures to assist investigators in future UAM accidents are required.

Two complementary vehicle-centric paths leading from existing concepts of operation to autonomous UAM are described. One path, denoted the Piloted Aircraft Path, focuses on how pilots and air traffic controller roles, responsibilities, and training must evolve to prepare for autonomous UAM. The Piloted Aircraft Path calls for incremental introduction of new autonomy modules and displays, moving first to single-pilot operations after which the single-pilot moves offboard and is replaced by a ground-based monitoring and control station. The second path, the Pilotless Aircraft Path, describes how autonomy and communication technologies must advance such that existing concepts of operation for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) can become sufficiently safe to ultimately support passenger payloads.

One such propulsion technology that has potential to increase efficiency and reduce noise is “stacked rotors.” Stacked rotors consist of multiple co-rotating rotors positioned co-axially with a small axial offset. The literature indicates that the wake-to-blade, blade-to-wake, and blade-to-blade interactions contribute significantly to the overall rotor performance. The complex interactions between wakes and blades are difficult to model theoretically without using high-fidelity tools, such as computational fluid dynamics codes, which are computationally expensive thus limited in their use for design. In an attempt to obtain a computationally efficient analysis of stacked rotor performance for use in early phase design, we develop a new method that combines a 2D panel method with blade element theory to estimate the performance of stacked rotors/propellers. When comparing our method to experimental results, the largest discrepancy for the lower rotor was an overprediction of thrust coefficient by 7.5%, while the largest discrepancy for the upper rotor was an underprediction of thrust coefficient by 15.7%. Our predictions somewhat follow the experimental trends in thrust coefficient.

In this paper, we explore the potential of a near-term small-scale UAM service that avoids many of these challenges through the use of a currently available general aviation airplane retrofitted with an electric propulsion system. In particular, we investigate the applicability of a battery electric variant of the Cessna 208B Caravan for short-haul intracity commuter trips in U.S. cities. Missions with a range of up to 50 nautical miles at a cruise speed of 150 kts are anticipated to be feasible using current battery technology. Based on the opportunity to reduce passenger commuting time compared to driving, we find that in certain U.S. cities with geographic constraints and high levels of traffic congestion, there is significant potential demand for such a service, even considering the first-and last-mile challenges of trips to and from origin and destination airports. This type of UAM service might be a useful initial step as a “minimum viable product” to assess the public’s willingness to adopt aviation for short ranged daily trips if the price point of the service can be reduced adequately via new technologies such as electric propulsion. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

UAM comprises a range of services that unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) could provide in densely populated cities; MVP provides a means of moving this service into the market while managing financial risk. Our approach identified candidate missions; selected the mission most suitable as an MVP; defined that reference mission to support further analysis; analyzed requirements, barriers, and challenges to commercial viability of the MVP; developed the business case; assessed pros and cons from the perspective of multiple stakeholders; and formulated a safety case. Our selected MVP use case was medical package delivery, a mission conducted using small UAS (<55 lb) vehicles that can accommodate a payload of up to 5 lb. Ensuring safety is the main challenge for implementation of the MVP. Our safety case applied a process developed by an international group of experts from national and regional aviation safety organizations. The analysis identified potential sources of ground risk (harm to persons on the ground) and air risk (collisions in the air), as well as potential mitigations to reduce the risks to acceptable levels. MVP implementation will also require significant initial investments, and the operations are not expected to be profitable for a few years. The cost of UAS package delivery will have to be close to that of existing services, though the advantages of speed and spontaneity for deliveries by UAS will allow some price premium. We see noise and perceived safety as the major barriers to public acceptance, and these will have to be addressed by demonstrating acceptable noise levels and a record of safe UAS operations. Although these needs represent significant barriers, our analysis concludes that they can be overcome with existing or near-term air vehicles, technologies, market demand, and operational procedures. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Three different levels of UAM traffic were evaluated in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area. The current-day helicopter routes were modified to separate them from traditional traffic, and a Letter of Agreement (LOA) was introduced in some of the conditions to reduce verbal communications. We found that modifications to the routes and introduction of LOA helped increase the number of UAM flights that the controllers reported they could manage and reduce their communications, which made controller self-reported workload more operationally acceptable. However, the self-reported workload experienced by busy airport towers cannot be effectively managed via the usage of LOA and modified helicopter routes, suggesting there is an opportunity to re-think roles and responsibilities of the UAM system participants. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This paper presents the development of turbocharger based mGTE and its integration with an electrical power pack. This mGTE is used for validating the concept of electro-mechanical interaction of these systems leading to electric power generation. The selection and sizing of the turbocharger center housing rotating assembly for the engine is carried out considering a wide range of industrial/consumer applications. All static parts including combustor have been designed and developed in view of the potential applications. The fuel-air mixture when burnt in the combustor expands across the turbine and exits through the exhaust nozzle to produce thrust. The energy in the exhaust gas is utilized for running the power turbine which in-turn is connected to an alternating current (AC) generator to produce electric power. A generator control unit that built in the alternator was used for voltage regulation. A control architecture has been designed to moderate the mGTE exhaust gas bypass valve in case of over-speeding of the alternator. Also, a resistor based variable load bank was designed to demonstrate generator performance. The system can be made to run on multiple fuels (for example, bio-gas, diesel or kerosene) with small changes to the combustion chamber. Few potential applications of the mGTE integrated power generator include decentralized power generation (microgrid), combined heating and cooling and laboratory platform for universities.

Second, the study develops containment boundaries for large transport aircraft operations at the three airports to demonstrate how these conventional operations may influence where and when emerging Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks may operate. 180 days of ASDE-X radar tracking data were analyzed to determine the location and traffic density of large transport aircraft, helicopters, and four other classes of operators. The flight trajectories for each operator class were sorted into arrivals, departures, and missed approaches to or from each runway. Containment boundaries were first developed for transport aircraft with greater than 100 passenger seats. Airspace that remained outside the containment boundary could potentially support simultaneous but non-interfering UAS or UAM operations. Variations in containment size due to airport-specific attributes were investigated. Containment boundary expansion to accommodate regional and commuter aircraft operations was assessed.

The algorithm plans conflict-free trajectories for flights to support a given set of UAM passenger trips. The UAM trips are planned in an on-demand, first-come, first-served manner, such that any given trip is subject to the constraints imposed by previously planned trips. For this analysis, the mission planning algorithm considered only the trajectory constraints from previously-planned trips in one test condition and added vertiport constraints for the second test condition. The conflict and constraint resolution strategies used by the Mission Planner were characterized by their percentage contribution to planning iterations, their percentage effectiveness in those iterations, and their contributions to the departure delay applied to each UAM trip’s flight. With the exception of the climb and descent vertical speed strategies, most strategies showed reasonable or good performance in all test scenarios. In the test condition with vertipad constraints enabled, both the total number of iterations executed, and the number of flights that required planning iterations, was reduced for all scenarios. This was the result of the natural conditioning of the traffic achieved with scheduling and the additional information available to the Mission Planner from the vertiport scheduler.

Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft have been investigated extensively but suffer from shortcomings related to rotor noise and vehicle energy efficiency. Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft present a unique capability to overcome some of these shortcomings while providing an easier path to certification.

Suitable airpark locations are first identified with the purpose of fitting runways. Prevailing weather patterns are then analyzed to identify appropriate sets of runway orientations. Surrounding obstacles identified using LIDAR data provided by the United States Geological Survey are analyzed next to generate ground roll as well as departure and approach gradient requirements.

In order to develop a safe and efficient system, numerous possible concepts of operation for UAM are being explored throughout industry and research domains, the features and assumptions of which may differ according to near, medium and far term operations. Much of the current research into the development of UAM has dominantly focused on technological and engineering capabilities, such as vehicle development. Although these areas of research are essential to furthering UAM, research into the role of the human operator in UAM is limited. The research described in this paper aims to begin to address this gap by investigating the capabilities and implications of human operators as traffic managers in the UAM system, focusing on near-term UAM operations. A human in the loop air traffic control simulation was used to investigate the effect of UAM traffic density, airspace routes and communication procedures on subjective workload and efficiency-related task performance. Findings indicate that medium and high-density operations were associated with high workload. A reduction in verbal communications through a letter of agreement, and optimized routes, were associated with reduced workload and increased performance efficiency. However, even with these adjustments, reported workload remained high, particularly during the high-density scenario. Future research should focus on the human operator roles and responsibilities, and the amount of involvement, in UAM system management. Particular focus should be directed on the impact of reduced human operator involvement and increased automation, on the safety and efficiency of UAM operations and the integration of UAM with traditional air traffic management. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The identification of airspace that is non-interfering and potentially “available” to these new operators is therefore a critical first step to support UAM integration. This paper introduces a geometric airspace assessment approach that considers seven existing airspace constructs. Four hypothetical ATM scenarios are developed that prescribe different degrees of UAM integration. An alpha-shape topological method is refined to process geometrically complex airspace construct polygons over an expansive geographic area and develop 3D mappings of airspace availability.

It is unclear at present how the eventual market will mature; however, one of the common design characteristics noted by many of the OEMs is the use of advanced materials such as composites. A test and analysis program was initiated at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) in 2018 to evaluate the impact attenuation capabilities of various composite material systems with the goal of eventual implementation into an eVTOL vehicle. A series of 3-inch diameter by 6-inch length tubular specimens were fabricated from different material systems which included both traditional carbon and hybrid woven layers of fibers. Additionally, a subset of specimens were filled with closed-cell polyisocyanurate foam to help both with stabilization and crush response. The ultimate goal of the test program was to design a specimen capable of limiting the sustained crush acceleration to 20 g through a stable crush progression. After a series of material tests, these specimens were evaluated under both static and dynamic conditions for impact energy attenuation characteristics and crush stability. Additionally, a series of simulation models were developed in parallel to the test efforts.

The goal is to develop software that will provide fast, accurate prediction of acoustic characteristics associated with DEP aircraft, including (1) noise generated by the simultaneous operation of multiple, variable RPM lifting and propelling rotors and props, (2) interacting rotor/prop/duct/airframe noise, including strut noise and prop/wing interaction noise, (3) broadband noise characteristic of eVTOL configurations, and (4) electric motor noise.

While these follow-on failures have often been blamed on either the Army user, Army developer or industry; they often come with biases from sideline participants without firsthand knowledge. The author of this paper has had mostly firsthand involvement and knowledge on these Army Aviation Development Programs over the past 45 years and he will seek to set the record straight. It will start with a review of Army Aviation Air Mobility Doctrine in the 1960s and it development and implementation in Southeast Asia, for which the author directly participated in. The initial implementation in South Vietnam was based on using off the shelf modified aircraft, predominantly helicopters. These lessons learned had a major impact on developing new aircraft and major modifications in the 1970s, e.g. UTTAS, AAH, CH-47D and OH-58D for which the author also directly participated in. There are critical lessons learned from this Air Mobility Doctrine development and the major aircraft programs which resulted from it, which are especially critical as the Army seeks major new development programs over the next decade. Also, it appears that the current focus on Urban Air Mobility (UAM) with the incorporation of new eVTOL aircraft, such as air taxis and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) into a low altitude Traffic Management (UTM) environment, also has a lot to learn from the Army’s Air Mobility Doctrine development and the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, e.g. helicopters,, that were developed to implement it.

The aircraft can be configured to carry a pilot and either three passengers or one passenger with a medical litter. A distributed electric propulsion (DEP) architecture is used, which facilitates wing blowing. Two outboard cruise propulsors near the wing tips continually operate, while eight inboard blowing propulsors provide burst power during takeoff, obstacle clearance, and landing. Power is provided by a varying combination of battery and turboshaft power. The MTOW is 2777 lb, the wing span is 37.1 ft, and the cruise L/D is 13.8. The takeoff and landing ground roll is 80 ft, and the cruise range is 100 nmi at 133 kts with a 30 min reserve. The cruise range can be extended up to 708 nmi when carrying only a pilot. This STOL aircraft offers a more-readily certifiable solution to the urban air mobility (UAM) design mission than eVTOL aircraft by not relying on battery power nor a fly-by-wire control system. Additionally, the design achieves an unblown stall speed of 49 kts and has glide capability. A geometric programming based sizing tool, GPkit, was used for aircraft sizing and optimization.

Vehicles used in future On Demand Mobility (ODM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations, whether flown with no onboard operator or with a minimally trained onboard operator, are expected to be similarly dependent on RF links for navigation, control, and communication with Air Traffic Control (ATC) (whether by a human or an automated system). Loss of even one of these links can present a significant hazard. For example, recent UAS accidents have often involved lost communication links. As the level of autonomy of UAS increases, loss of C2 links may not be directly catastrophic though it is still likely to be disruptive to airspace operations, and other RF links, particularly satellite navigation links, become essential for maintaining safe vehicle operations. The challenges of maintaining RF links will grow as operations of highly autonomous vehicles expand, and as envisioned future concepts of operation become a reality. Future aviation systems such as UAS operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) and air taxis operating as part of an envisioned UAM system will frequently operate at low altitudes far from established airports. At these low altitudes, terrain, buildings, and even vegetation can significantly impact RF coverage. This paper presents initial results of a research effort to integrate RF coverage analysis into the mission planning process for UAS and other future vehicles, such as air taxis. The overall research effort is developing tools to analyze coverage of both C2 and navigation links along an intended flight path, as well as automated path generation tools that produce mission plans that minimize the likelihood of RF link loss. This paper focuses on analysis of air-to-ground RF links, and mission planning to minimize the likelihood of loss of such links. Numerical examples focus on Manhattan, using a representative mission of passenger transport from LaGuardia airport to lower Manhattan to demonstrate both RF coverage analysis and path planning. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The approach leverages a simple aircraft performance model of sufficient abstraction to be suitable for a wide range of potential eVTOL configurations including lift plus cruise, quadcopter, and side-by-side helicopter configurations. Using this performance model, we examine sizing and performance of a presumed UAM network in the greater San Francisco area. The output from this model is used to determine the optimal size of the aircraft with respect to factors such as the number of flights completed and profitability. The optimal weight for maximizing the number of completed routes can be determined analytically and is the weight at which both the charger power and the allowable charge C-rate are maximized unless the aircraft must be larger to fly the sizing mission. The profitability is also determined analytically and follows trends similar to the optimal weight for routes completed. Finally, we explore sensitivities of profitability and routes completed to changes in specific energy, charger power, and charge C-rate. Increasing specific energy always increases profitability while charger power and charge C-rate must be increased together. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

We propose an obstacle distance safety metric to constrain the set of safe approach velocities for a small UAS (sUAS) flying in or near an urban canyon. Two case studies defining a sensor-aware flight envelope for fixed wing and multicopter aircraft equipped with onboard LiDAR and GPS are presented to validate this proposed metric. Maximum steady level flight velocity is constrained by both vehicle performance and sensor limitations, resulting in a set of modified flight envelopes that consider both. Our distance metric not only aids in determining the set of safe velocities for the UAS, it also provides a method to determine onboard UAS sensor requirements at design time, i.e., accuracy and range, based on vehicle performance limitations such as stall speed, deceleration profile, and turn radius. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Motivated by a surge in commuter air travel, the industry is rapidly propos-ing and adopting new vehicle concepts to meet consumer demands. However, variability in mission profiles and strong interdependencies of vehicle components present several challenges when implementing traditional aircraft design methodologies. Due to the absence of a “tried-and-true” approach, eVTOL concepts have come in all imaginable sizes and configurations. This has led to the creation of high-dimensional and computationally expensive optimization problems. In this paper, potential design strategies are presented and compared, identifying design variables and constraints which take precedence during a particular optimization. A novel weight build-up approach to estimating operating empty weight is also introduced. The results of this study were then used to restructure the methodology employed in the preliminary stages of conceptual eVTOL design.

Conflict avoidance is a core research problem to enable UAM for high density operations. As the outer layer of protection, pre-departure planning can optimize trajectory under physical and operation constraints, coordinate flights with existing flight plans, alleviate the burden of inner layer sense and avoid, and increase the predictability of an operation. Dynamic geofence is a moving region of reserved airspace for an aircraft, which provides a safety buffer for various uncertainties including flight operation, localization and disturbances from weather. This paper is an endeavor to do pre-departure conflict-free trajectory planning for flight with dynamic geofence in structured airspace. We propose an efficient, scalable, two-phase, linear programming based algorithm. In the first phase of the algorithm, we discretize the flight into time periods and formulate an integer programming model, which is proved to be Totally Unimodular (TU), to avoid conflict with already filed flight plans and to determine the location of dynamic geofence in each time period. In the second phase, we propose a velocity profile smoothing model to make the trajectory easier to fly.

This research focuses on the formulation of fixed-final-time multiphase optimal control problem with energy consumption as the performance index for a multirotor eVTOL aircraft. The proposed multiphase optimal control problem formulation and the numerical solution enables a multirotor eVTOL aircraft to meet the assigned required time of arrival and achieve an energy-efficient arrival trajectory for a given concept of operation (CONOP), which is a critical enabler for the safe and efficient future eVTOL operations for passenger transportation and cargo delivery. The problem formulation is applied to a UAM passenger transportation use case with EHang 184 eVTOL aircraft, and an Uber-proposed vertiport for five different types of CONOPs. Finally, the energy consumed for all the CONOPs is compared to propose the most energy-efficient CONOP for a multirotor eVTOL on UAM passenger transportation mission.

When evaluating the introduction of UAM, understanding the potential users’ choice behavior regarding current available urban transportation modes and autonomous transportation services is essential to demand estimation. This preliminary research intends to gain insight into the travel behavior impacts of autonomous transportation modes, especially UAM, by deriving measures for transportation service attributes and identifying characteristics of potential users who might adopt autonomous transportation services, particularly the services of UAM. Thus, a stated preference questionnaire was designed and distributed in Munich metropolitan region. A main mode choice multinomial logit model and several sub-models, based on market segmentation, were estimated regarding four transportation alternatives: private car, public transportation, autonomous taxi, and autonomous flying taxi. The results indicate that travel time, travel cost, and safety may be critical determinants in autonomous transportation mode adoption. The potential consumers may be willing to pay more for using autonomous transportation modes, especially the service of UAM. Among different market segments, younger individuals, as well as older individuals with high household income, are more likely to adopt UAM. In addition, during the market entry stage, potential travelers may favor UAM particularly for performing non-commuting trips. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",

In this study, extension of the database for the delayed neutron data (DND) is performed by exploring more delayed neutron experiments and adding additional isotopes/actinides to the data libraries. Afterwards, the framework is utilized to obtain a deeper knowledge of the kinetic parameters' sensitivity and uncertainty. The kinetic parameters include precursor-group-wise delayed neutron fraction (DNF) and decay constant. Input uncertainties include nuclear data (i.e., cross-sections) and DND (i.e., precursor group parameters and fractional delayed neutron yield). It is found that kinetic parameters, especially DNFs, have large uncertainties. The DNF uncertainty is driven by the cross-section uncertainties for LWR designs, while decay constant uncertainty is dominated by the DND uncertainties. The usage of correlated U-235 thermal DND in the UQ process significantly reduces the DND uncertainty contribution on the kinetic parameters. Large void fraction and presence of neutron absorber (e.g., control rod) increase the DNF uncertainty due to the hardening of neutron spectrum. High correlation between the DNF groups (β1,.,β6) is observed, while the decay constant groups (1,.,6) show weak correlation to each other and also to DNF groups. The DNF uncertainties of the dominant precursor group 4 for PWR, BWR, and VVER are about 7.5%, 9.4%, and 7.6%, respectively. The DNF uncertainty grows to larger values after fuel burnup. Kinetic parameters' values and uncertainties provided here can be efficiently used in subsequent core calculations, point reactor kinetics, and other applications. © 2019 Majdi I. Radaideh et al.",

This report describes a case of UAM of the mandible in a seven-year-old girl. The lesion radiographically mimicked a dentigerous cyst. Under the primary diagnosis of a dentigerous cyst, marsupialization was performed to erupt the first molar involved in the cystic lesion and to obtain a definitive diagnosis. The biopsy specimen revealed ameloblastoma. During careful observation, orthodontic treatment, which was performed to upright and promote the eruption of the first molar involved in the tumor, maintained the space needed for enucleation of the tumor. Finally, the second primary molar was extracted, and the lesion was enucleated at 3 years and 4 months after marsupialization. The results of the histological examination revealed UAM. Conclusively, the treatment course not only avoids a resection of the mandible but also induces eruption of the teeth involved in the tumor.

In contrast, maxillary AMs appear to harbor more frequently RAS, FGFR2, or SMO mutations.

The aim of this study was to characterize the mutation profile of UAM (n = 39) and to compare it to conventional AM (n = 39). The associations between mutation status and recurrence probability were also analyzed. In the mandible, 94% of UAMs (29/31, including 8/8 luminal, 6/8 intraluminal, and 15/15 mural subtypes) and 74% of AMs (28/38) revealed BRAF V600E mutations. Among the BRAF wild-type cases, 1 UAM showed a missense SMO mutation (p.L412F), whereas 2 NRAS (p.Q61R), 2 HRAS (p.Q61R), and 2 FGFR2 (p.C383R) activating mutations were identified in AM. Of the 3 maxillary UAMs, only 1 revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate high frequency of activating BRAF V600E mutations in both UAM and AM of the mandible. In maxillary UAMs, the BRAF V600E mutation prevalence appears to be lower as was shown for AM previously. It could therefore be argued that UAM and AM are part of the spectrum of the same disease. AMs without BRAF V600E mutations were associated with an increased rate of local recurrence (P = 0.0003), which might indicate that routine mutation testing also has an impact on prognosis. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2018.","drug therapy; genetic markers; jaw neoplasms; mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases; odontogenic tumors; survival analysis"

Mobility is one such service that is witnessing transformation towards an end user orientation, aiming for a seamless journey, from end to end, that crosses the boundaries between modes of transportation and transaction. In this paper, we focus on the role of aviation in the inter-modal end-to-end journey. In particular, we focus on a key enabler - a system wide information management system (SWIM) that is key to sharing data between the different modes of transportation, their systems, stakeholders and users. We assess the role of aviation in inter-modal mobility in two respects: (1) Aviation as a segment in an inter-modal journey. Air transportation is inter-modal since, as aircraft carry passengers from gate to gate, other modes of transportation are necessary to complete the journey between the gates and the end points of the trip. We will discuss the impact of connectivity and end user orientation on this traditional air transportation model. (2) Aviation serving end-to-end markets. As most inter-modal efforts have focused on urban mobility, where multiple modes of transportation compete and complement each other, aviation remained largely foreign to this integration. This is likely to change with the advent of urban air mobility (UAM), which promises to compete with other modes of transportation in the urban environment. This transformation will require end-to-end, user-oriented air travel models, unlike the traditional gate-to-gate models. We will expand on extending SWIM adopted for aviation to other modes of mobility as a core enabler for real-time data sharing across modalities, networks, and seamless mobility. SWIM has been a successful Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) technology for increasing information sharing among the stakeholders of the national airspace system (NAS). It enabled connecting the aircraft, the airline operators, and the service providers to increase collaborative and distributed decision making (CDM). Expanding such a technology to connect with and among the other modes of mobility and with passengers, will be key for enabling seamless mobility. ""SWIM consists of standards, infrastructure, and governance that enable the management of air traffic management (ATM)-related information and how it is exchanged between users"". This is an important concept as we start to exchange data between the airlines and add new entrants into the NAS such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and UAM and share information with other transportation networks. For example, exchanging data with the airlines through SWIM collaborative decision making (CDM) enabled automated sequencing and scheduling of flights. Moreover, this platform has enabled creating better prediction algorithms and helps air traffic controllers manage workload. The paper will identify and discuss a Seamless Mobility Information architecture expanding on the SWIM capabilities and model which is a key for end to end mobility. In addition, it will propose an application in disruption management that can be developed and researched. © 2018 IEEE.","Data exchange; Disruption management; Multi-modal; Network; SWIM; Total mobility; UAM"

In the long term with more UAM flights, air traffic control is expected to limit further growth of such operations. Therefore, a first research has been performed on energy-efficient trajectory optimisation for a given required time of arrival, as the arrival phase is the most safety-critical flight phase with much higher air traffic density and limited battery energy. However, research on the computation of the optimal required time of arrival (RTA) for eVTOL aircraft has not yet been performed. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters in commercial aviation, eVTOL aircraft have different flight dynamics, limited battery energy supply and a limited number of landing spots at a vertiport such as the top of high-rise buildings. This work is the first to utilise a mixed-integer linear program that computes the optimal RTAs for eVTOLs to safely separate them for minimum delay based on remaining battery state of charge and vertiport capacity. A concept of operations for vertiport terminal area airspace design is also proposed while making use of the existing energy-efficient trajectory optimisation tool. The research serves as a basis for further development of safe and efficient UAM operations. The mathematical model can also be applied to Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) by inserting new separation requirements and flight dynamics for smaller drones when optimising a high density arrival terminal airspace. © 2018 IEEE.","Arrival; EVTOL; On-demand; Scheduling; Sequencing; Urban Air Mobility"

The concept focusses on the integration of new airspace users (e.g., UAS and Urban Air Taxis) into uncontrolled airspace (here airspace G). The advantage of the proposed concept is that it opens up the airspace equally for lowly equipped and highly-equipped UAS. The concept gives incentives for UAS manufacturers and operators to invest in performance relevant technology, but doesn't exclude lowly equipped airspace users from entering the U-Space airspace. The concept behind this approach relies on efficient airspace segmentation and UAS performance modelling. Based on airspace characteristics (e.g. ground class, geofences, U-Space service availability, occurrence of VFR-traffic or other non-cooperative airspace users) the airspace is segmented into cells of similar requirements. Generally, each airspace user is modelled by an ellipsoid defining its individual performance parameters with regard to navigation, communication and the capability to detect other airspace users (cooperatively and uncooperatively). The lower the overall performance, the larger the resulting safety ellipsoid will be for the aircraft. As a result, an airspace cell might either be used solely by few aircraft with a large ellipsoid - reaching the cell's capacity - or several aircraft with smaller ellipsoids. This results in an airspace management which allows a lot of freedom at low density, but little freedom at high density. © 2018 IEEE.","Performance based; Traffic management; U-Space; UAM; UTM"

An immunohistochemistry technique was performed, with antibodies against Ki-67, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM6, in 10 AM and 10 UAM tumors. The results were quantified using label index and analyzed statistically. Results. AM and UAM had greater expression of MCM6, followed by MCM5, MCM4, and Ki-67 (P <.05). Immunoexpression of Ki-67 and MCM5 was exclusively nuclear, whereas the expression of MCM4 and MCM6 was nuclear and cytoplasmic. Conclusion. The results suggest that MCM5 is a trustable cell proliferation marker with higher sensitivity compared with Ki-67 and may be useful to predict the biological behavior of AM and UAM.

In literature, most of the existing approaches for expression recognition mainly rely on manual annotations by experts, which is both time-consuming and difficult to obtain. Hence, we propose an unsupervised framework for spontaneous expression recognition that preserves discriminative information for the videos of each expression without using annotations. Initially, a large Gaussian mixture model called universal attribute model (UAM) is trained to learn the attributes of various expressions implicitly. Attributes are the movements of various facial muscles that are combined to form a particular facial expression. Then, a concatenated mean vector called the super expression-vector (SEV) is formed by using a maximum a posteriori adaptation of the UAM means for each expression clip. This SEV contains attributes from all the expressions resulting in a high dimensional representation. To retain only the attributes of that particular expression clip, the SEV is decomposed using factor analysis to produce a low-dimensional expression-vector. This procedure does not require any class labels and produces expression-vectors that are distinct for each expression irrespective of high inter-actor variability present in spontaneous expressions. On spontaneous expression datasets like BP4D and AFEW, we demonstrate that expression-vector achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we also show that UAM trained on a constrained data set can be effectively used to recognize expressions in unconstrained expression videos. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","Expression recognition; factor analysis; feature extraction; Gaussian mixture model; map adaptation; universal attribute model"

Yet, such models still typically implement a discrete step between the last cognitive stage and motor implementation. This discrete step is implemented as a fixed decision bound that activation in the last cognitive stage needs to cross before action can be initiated. Such an implementation is questionable as it cannot account for two important features of behavior. First, it does not allow to select an action while withholding it until the moment is appropriate for executing it. Second, it cannot account for recent evidence that cognition is not confined prior to movement initiation, but consistently leaks into movement. To address these two features, we propose a novel neurocomputational model of cognitionaction interactions, namely the unfolding action model (UAM). Crucially, the model implements adaptive information flow between the last cognitive processing stage and motor implementation. We show that the UAM addresses the two abovementioned features. Empirically, the UAM accounts for traditional response time data, including positively skewed initiation time distribution, functionally fixed decision bounds and speed-accuracy trade-offs in button-press experimental designs. Moreover, it accounts for movement times, movement paths, and how they are influenced by cognitive-experimental manipulations.

Neither HWM nor UAM affected the viability of mouse skin fibroblasts (NIH/3 T3) below 100 μg/mL. UAM had a higher yield production, phenol concentration, and in vitro antioxidant activity, but it had a lower viscosity and water-holding capacity than that of HWM. The Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that the dialyzed HWM and UAM, named HWMD and UAMD, respectively, appeared to have major spectral differences at 1730 cm−1 and 1605 cm−1, implying that the degree of methylation was different between HWMD and UAMD. Compared to HWMD, UAMD in low-molecular weight polysaccharides increased. Indeed, the basic characteristics of native mucilage in the carpel of N. odorata were greatly changed by various extractions.

Due to the nature of lightweight and flexibility of micro flapping wing structures, elastic deformation as a result of aeroelastic coupling is inevitable in flapping motion. This effect can be significant and beneficial to the aerodynamic performance as revealed in the present investigation for a flexible flapping wing of variable camber versus a rigid one. Firstly a two dimensional (2D) unsteady aerodynamic model (UAM) based on potential flow theory has been extended from previous study. Both leading and trailing edge discrete vortices are included in the model with unsteady Kutta condition satisfied to fully characterize the unsteady flow around a flapping wing. A wall function is created to modify the induced velocity of the vortices in the UAM to solve the vortices penetration problem. The modified UAM is then validated by comparing with CFD results of a typical insect-like flapping motion from previous research. Secondly the UAM is further extended for a flexible flapping wing of camber variation. Comparing with a rigid wing in a prescribed plunging and pitching motion, the results show lift increase with positive camber in upstroke by mitigating negative lift. The results also agree well with CFD simulation. Thirdly the 2D UAM is extended to calculate the aerodynamic forces of a 3D wing with camber variation, and validated by CFD results. Finally the model is applied to aerodynamic analysis of a 3D flexible flapping wing with aeroelastic coupling effect. Significant increase of lift coefficient can be achieved for a flexible flapping wing of positive camber and twist in upstroke produced by the structure elastic deformation. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Aeroelastic coupling; Flapping wing; Unsteady aerodynamic model; Variable camber"

Flow channel inserts made of SiC will be exposed to tritium from the Li transmutation, as well as to neutron and gamma radiation. Hence a critical issue for future fusion devices is to clarify hydrogen isotope behaviour in SiC under such conditions. The objective of the work presented here is to study the effect of ionizing radiation on the deuterium trapping in Reaction Bonded SiC in similar conditions as reactor materials. This effect is evaluated by studying the influence of ionizing radiation on deuterium trapping (for both implanted and loaded SiC samples). Moreover, it is investigated how deuterium trapping may be modified by displacement damage. The ionizing radiation effect on absorption has also been evaluated for samples pre-damaged by self-ion irradiation. The irradiation and implantation experiment have been carried out at the CMAM-UAM accelerator, and the Danfysik implanter and 2 MeV Van de Graaff electron accelerator at CIEMAT. Samples are analysed by thermal desorption spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to clarify the mechanisms involved in the trapping processes, depending on the different experimental conditions. The results for the deuterium loaded samples indicate that absorption is increased by ionizing radiation. When samples are pre-damaged by C+4 ions, deuterium absorption is increased in the form of Si-D according to SIMS results. Furthermore, the effect of ionizing radiation after deuterium implantation is an enhancement of the deuterium released from SiC. The deuterium release observed in this case is forming hydrocarbons during irradiations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Desorption; Deuterium absorption; Deuterium implantation; Displacement damage; Ionization irradiation; Trapping"

Task-oriented optimal control strategies can also further improve the flight time by generating energy-optimal coordinated motions. This paper addresses the dynamic modeling, trajectory tracking and control of an UAM that consists of an under-actuated rotary-wing UAV, with a novel pitch-hover-maneuvering capability, and a 2-DOF robotic arm. A decoupled velocity-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy is proposed for tracking a trajectory in the sagittal plane of the UAM while the UAV base pitch hovers in place. Conventional PD controllers were used to generate set-point velocity screws as the inputs to the MPC. A partitioned (but complete) dynamic model of the UAM was developed and used for implementing the proposed control strategy in a simulated environment. The MPC controller takes the force/torque exerted (by the arm) on the UAV base into account and augments the desired control inputs accordingly. The proposed control strategy provides the following advantages: (1) it can be implemented in real time since a linearized dynamic model of the UAV base is used, (2) it provides a generic control structure that can be applied to different classes of UAMs. © 2018 IEEE.",

The accuracy of this approach is unclear. Methods Day of transplant sera from 211 complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch-negative patients were retrospectively analyzed for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) using Luminex technology. HLA were defined as UAM if DSA had mean fluorescence intensity above (I) 3000 (patients retransplanted and those with DSA against HLA class I and II) or 5000 (all other patients), (II) 5000 for HLA-A, -B, and -DR and 10 000 for HLA DQ or (III) 10 000 (all HLA). We then studied the accuracy of these algorithms to identify patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and graft loss. UAM were also determined in 256 transplant candidates and vPRA levels calculated. Results At transplantation, 67 of 211 patients had DSA. Of these, 31 (algorithm I), 24 (II) and 17 (III) had UAM. Nine (I and II) and 8 (III) of 11 early AMR episodes and 7 (I), 6 (II) and 5 (III) of 9 graft losses occurred in UAM-positive patients during 4.9 years of follow-up. Algorithms I and II identified patients with persistently lower glomerular filtration rate even in the absence of overt AMR. Of the waiting list patients, 22-33% had UAM with median virtual panel reactive antibody of 69.2% to 79.1%. Conclusions Algorithms I and II had comparable efficacy but were superior to Algorithm III in identifying at-risk patients at an acceptable false-positive rate. However, Luminex-defined UAM significantly restrict the donor pool of affected patients, which might prolong waiting time. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Snatch thefts are complex actions containing attributes like walking, running etc. which are affected by actor and view variations. To capture the variation in these attributes in diverse scenarios, we propose to model snatch thefts using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a large number of mixtures known as universal attribute model (UAM). However, the number of snatch thefts typically recorded in a surveillance videos is not sufficient enough to train the parameters of the UAM. Hence, we use the large human action datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51 to train the UAM as many of the actions in these datasets share attributes with snatch thefts. Then, a super-vector representation for each snatch theft clip is obtained using maximum aposteriori (MAP) adaptation of the universal attribute model. However, super-vectors are high-dimensional and contain many redundant attributes which do not contribute to snatch thefts. So, we propose to use factor analysis to obtain a low-dimensional representation called action-vector that contains only the relevant attributes. For evaluation, we introduce a video dataset called Snatch 1.0 created from many hours of surveillance footage obtained from different traffic cameras placed in the city of Hyderabad, India. We show that using action-vectors snatch thefts can be better identified than existing state-of-the-art feature representations. © 2018","Action recognition; Factor analysis; Gaussian mixture model; Snatch theft detection; Surveillance"

Healthcare workforce scarcities present in these locations result in poor perioperative care access and quality. These scarcities also limit the capacity for progressive development and enhancement of workforce training, and skills through continuing medical education. Newly available low-cost, in-situ simulation systems make it possible for a small cadre of trainers to use simulation to identify areas needing improvement and to rehearse best practice approaches, relevant to the context of target environments. Methods: Nurse anesthetists were recruited throughout Sierra Leone to participate in simulation-based obstetric anesthesia scenarios at the country's national referral maternity hospital. All subjects participated in a detailed computer assisted training program to familiarize themselves with the Universal Anesthesia Machine (UAM). An expert panel rated the morbidity/mortality risk of pre-identified critical incidents within the scenario via the Delphi process. Participant responses to critical incidents were observed during these scenarios. Participants had an obstetric anesthesia pretest and post-test as well as debrief sessions focused on reviewing the significance of critical incident responses observed during the scenario. Results: 21 nurse anesthetists, (20% of anesthesia providers nationally) participated. Median age was 41 years and median experience practicing anesthesia was 3.5 years. Most participants (57.1%) were female, two-thirds (66.7%) performed obstetrics anesthesia daily but 57.1% had no experience using the UAM.

Conclusion: This study identified substantial risks to patient care and provides evidence to support the feasibility and value of in-situ simulation-based performance assessment for identifying critical gaps in safe anesthesia care in the low-resource settings.

Currently, the code is under development but some important steps have been made in the verification procedure of the code. A composite nodal method for prismatic hexagons has been developed and applied to solve the neutron diffusion equations for cores built by the union, side by side, of hexagonal prisms. A standard finite element method is used starting by the strong form to get the corresponding weak form. The verification and validation process of the AZNHEX code started with some academic exercises. In the case of this paper, in order to move to much more realistic scenarios, the OECD/NEA UAM Sodium Fast Reactor Benchmark has been used together with the SERPENT code for further verification. One of the exercises of the OECD/NEA Sodium Fast Reactor Benchmark is focused on the neutronic characterization of global parameters (keff, sodium void worth, Doppler, etc.) and feedback coefficient evaluation. This Benchmark is intended to confirm the ability of participants and their neutronic codes to provide generally consistent results when analyzing SFR core characteristics and thus, it represents a very good exercise for the AZNHEX development team. The differences in keff of AZNHEX versus the well validated deterministic codes DYN3D and PARCS are 70 pcm and 113 pcm respectively when using the same set of XS previously generated with the stochastic code SERPENT. Also, the radial power distribution compared between the deterministic codes over the main diagonal of the core presented very good agreement among them. In other exercises, differences in the order of 200 pcm, in the worst cases, were found when comparing integral parameters with SERPENT. The AZNHEX results give the confidence to keep developing the code in order to convert it into the standard domestic tool for hexagonal-z geometry core analysis. Future developments on the code will be focused on the implementation of discontinuity factors and the thermal expansion effects in an operating core as well as the time dependent implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","AZNHEX for FR analysis; Hexagonal-z geometry solver; Neutron diffusion code AZNHEX; OECD/NEA UAM Sodium Fast Reactor Benchmark"

Arabinose is a constituent of many different cell wall components, including pectic rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and II (RG-II), glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAX), and arabinoxyloglucan (AXG). Arabinose is found predominantly in the furanose rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. The UDP-arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs) have been demonstrated to convert UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) to UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The UAMs have been implicated in polysaccharide biosynthesis and developmental processes. Arabinose residues could be a component of many polysaccharides, including branched (1→5)-α-arabinans, arabinogalactans in pectic polysaccharides, and arabinoxyloglucans, which are abundant in the cell walls of solanaceous plants. Therefore, to elucidate the role of UAMs and arabinan side chains, we analyzed the UAM RNA interference transformants in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The tobacco UAM gene family consists of four members. We generated RNAi transformants (NtUAM-KD) to down-regulate all four of the UAM members. The NtUAM-KD showed abnormal leaf development in the form of a callus-like structure and many holes in the leaf epidermis. A clear reduction in the pectic arabinan content was observed in the tissue of the NtUAM-KD leaf. The arabinose/xylose ratio in the xyloglucan-rich cell wall fraction was drastically reduced in NtUAM-KD. These results suggest that UAMs are required for Ara side chain biosynthesis in both RG-I and AXG in Solanaceae plants, and that arabinan-mediated cell wall networks might be important for normal leaf expansion. © 2017, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK.","Arabinoxyloglucan; Nicotiana tabacum; Rhamnogalacturonan-I; UDP-arabinopyranose mutase"

There is also evidence that music can enhance imagery (Grocke and Wigram, 2007), although few studies have investigated the effects of music on imagery in the context of sport skills. In the present study, the effects of relaxing and arousing music during imagery on dart-throwing performance, physiological arousal indices, and competitive state anxiety, were investigated among 63 novice dart throwers. Participants had moderate-to-high imagery ability and were randomly assigned to unfamiliar relaxing music (URM), unfamiliar arousing music (UAM), or no music (NM) groups. Performance was assessed by 40 dart throws at a concentric circles dartboard before and after 12 imagery sessions over 4 weeks. Measures of galvanic skin response (GSR), peripheral temperature (PT), and heart rate (HR) were taken during imagery sessions 1 and 12, and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 Revised (CSAI-2R) was administered prior to the pre- and post-intervention performance task. Dart-throwing gain scores were significantly higher for URM than for UAM and NM, with no significant difference between UAM and NM (URM = 37.24 ± 5.66, UAM = 17.57 ± 5.30, and NM = 13.19 ± 6.14, F2,62 = 5.03, p = 0.01, η2 = 0.14). GSR, PT, and HR reflected lower arousal for URM than for UAM or NM. Significant decreases in somatic anxiety were evident for URM and UAM but not NM. Significant decreases in cognitive anxiety were evident for URM and NM but not UAM. Significant increases in self-confidence were evident for URM but not UAM or NM. Performance improved in all three conditions but URM was associated with the largest performance gain, the lowest physiological indices of arousal, and the most positive CSAI-2R profiles.

Photocatalytic experiments were performed with methylene blue dye which is considered as model organic pollutant in textile industry. A comparative analysis between the RNP and commercially available Degussa P25 for photocatalytic performance against dye removal efficiency was performed. The rapid removal of methylene blue in case of RNP indicates their higher photocatalytic activity than P25. Maximum dye removal efficiency 98.45% was achieved with optimal conditions i.e. TTIP conc. 10 mL, EG conc. 4 mL and sonication time 1 h.

To derive total nuclear data uncertainties, Latin hypercube sampled nuclear data libraries arc utilized. However, it is also desirable to derive uncertainties of core simulation output parameters (e.g. enthalpy deposition in an REA) to nuclear data uncertainties for specific nuclide-reaction pairs. This allows the key uncertainly contributions to be identified and ranked. A novel methodology has been developed in WIMS to facilitate the efficient derivation of covarianccs between macroscopic cross sections and hence the development of sampled macroscopic cross sections for use in PANTHER.

This evolutionary variability is strongly influenced by the structural properties of the site in the native structure, and it is quantified either through sequence entropy or through substitution rates. However, while the sequence entropy only depends on the equilibrium frequencies of the amino acids, the substitution rate also depends on the exchangeability matrix that describes mutations in the mathematical model of the substitution process. Here we apply two variants of a mathematical model of protein evolution with selection for protein stability, both against unfolding and against misfolding. Exploiting the approximation of independent sites, these models allow computing site-specific substitution processes that satisfy global constraints on folding stability. We find that site-specific substitution rates do not depend only on the selective constraints acting on the site, quantified through its sequence entropy. In fact, polar sites evolve faster than hydrophobic sites even for equal sequence entropy, as a consequence of the fact that polar amino acids are characterized by higher mutational exchangeability than hydrophobic ones. Accordingly, the model predicts that more polar proteins tend to evolve faster. Nevertheless, these results change if we compare proteins that evolve under different mutation biases, such as orthologous proteins in different bacterial genomes. In this case, the substitution rates are faster in genomes that evolve under mutational bias that favor hydrophobic amino acids by preferentially incorporating the nucleotide Thymine that is more frequent in hydrophobic codons. This appearingly contradictory result arises because buried sites occupied by hydrophobic amino acids are characterized by larger selective factors that largely amplify the substitution rate between hydrophobic amino acids, while the selective factors of exposed sites have a weaker effect. Thus, changes in the mutational bias produce deep effects on the biophysical properties of the protein (hydrophobicity) and on its evolutionary properties (sequence entropy and substitution rate) at the same time.

Some benefits were realized using the LNG's cryogenic properties to reduce some electrical component losses and cooling requirements. Significant questions were raised concerning volume and thermal management considerations for all studied systems. The notional, baseline vehicle was a hybrid helicopter / airplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), balancing high cruise efficiency with reasonable hover capability. A subsequent power system assessment using the same notional vehicle and mission was performed that identified increased volume and power requirements for the active cooling required. The cooling airflow could also generate additional drag on the vehicle during operation. For the notional vehicle studied, the additional volume identified by the subsequent study would not affect vehicle mold line and therefore drag. However, the additional drag from cooling airflow and the power to circulate it as needed would impact power system and vehicle mission performance. Vehicle and mission models were updated and rerun. Updated results still indicated significant benefits in range and number of UAM missions, but reduced the benefit by 12-15%. Hold time for the hybrid systems also generally increased a few minutes because of reduced power available for charging from the power for required cooling flows.

In this paper we describe our three-pronged approach to studying passenger-carrying UAM missions, and we detail the first phase of this approach, which consists of defining an initial set of requirements for multiple exemplar UAM missions. The development of these mission requirements provides justifiable assumptions that feed the second phase of the approach, which is performing aircraft conceptual design studies. Vehicle design is not included in this paper, but the work described here will define sizing missions for follow-on design and sizing studies. The aircraft that emerge from the design studies can then feed the third phase of our UAM analysis approach, which involves simulating an entire UAM network over a metropolitan area to study transportation-system level characteristics. Iteration between each of the three phases of the UAM analysis approach will be necessary to propagate lessons learned as our research progresses and as the UAM community coalesces on a more unified vision for UAM.

Traffic congestion in leading metro areas is increasing and leading to significant increases in commuting time and pollution. This leads to a renewed interest in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts of operations to improve efficiency and mitigate some of these concerns. Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft have been investigated extensively, but suffer from shortcomings related to rotor noise and overall vehicle energy efficiency. Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft present a unique capability to overcome some of these shortcomings, provided a viable concept of operations leading to tangible benefits to customers can be constructed. The objective of this research is to generate a parametric environment to analyze the door-to-door travel time for several origin and destination (O&D) pairs within an urban and suburban environment. Travel times are then compared for two modes of transportations: personal cars and a mix of ground ridesharing and air transportation using STOL aircraft. The sensitivity of the door-to-door travel time to airpark geo-density and various vehicle performance attributes is assessed to help derive requirements for future concepts of operations featuring STOL aircraft.

Significant investment and rapid development of vehicles for this activity is taking place, with package delivery services already beginning in some areas. However, the ability to manage thousands of these vehicles safely in a congested urban area presents a challenge unprecedented in air traffic management. Initial studies of this problem led by NASA under the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) initiative have primarily focused on geo-fencing and centralized reservation of airspace for individual flights. This paper proposes an extension of UTM using a de-centralized approach employing airborne surveillance, self-separation, and a minimized “design separation” approach to permit the optimization and safety of each flight in very high traffic densities and close proximities. The concept employs Airborne Trajectory Management (ABTM) principles and a novel new concept for variable separation criteria to manage the angular velocity of a passing vehicle, thus eliminating the ""startle factor"" and perceived hazard of very close operations. ABTM also accomplishes most of the services required for safe planning and execution of normal flights and recovery from abnormal or emergency operations while accommodating conventional piloted flights using the current air traffic control paradigm. The environment for UAM operations is described along with the proposed means for autonomous, tactical separation of the vehicles.

UAM or ODM systems featuring these capabilities typically have a smaller ground footprint but are subject to a number of performance compromises that make sizing and optimizing the vehicles more challenging. These design challenges can be further compounded when additional environmental considerations are taken into account and in particular if electric propulsion is considered. Alternative architectures such as short takeoff and landing (STOL) and super-short takeoff and landing (SSTOL) vehicles are thus investigated because they present possible advantages in terms of energy efficiency, overall vehicle performance, and noise footprint. However, the larger ground footprint of the infrastructure necessary to operate these systems means that these systems may be more difficult to integrate into a urban and suburban environment.

This model provides the ability to assess many parameters, including the number of vehicles needed in the system to meet demand, the number of vehicles airborne at any given time, and the length of time vehicles may have to loiter before a landing pad becomes available. We focus our initial studies with the model on exploring the UAM system-level implications of different energy storage systems on UAM vehicles. Specifically, we compare fully-battery-electric vehicles to vehicles with multiple hybrid-electric powertrains, which consist of different energy conversion systems (i.e., engines and fuel cells) and fuels. The transportation system-level model provides insight into vertiport ground infrastructure requirements, such as the number of recharging or refueling stations and the impact of various vehicle powertrains on these requirements. Ultimately, results indicate that the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel in a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell-battery-turbine system can result in a vehicle power system that provides lower operating costs, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and lower power system weights than pure batteryelectric solutions at the same power level while also having fewer infrastructure integration issues. Additionally, a hybrid internal combustion engine-generator-battery solution fueled with LNG provides a near-equivalent energy cost solution to pure battery-electric power systems at the same power level, but at a much lower system mass.

High density requires channelization of high-throughput portions of the airspace to manage pair-wise conflicts. This leads to the requirement to merge different streams of traffic without leading to congestion. Three-dimensional airspace provides an extra degree of freedom for merging that is not readily available for surface traffic, the paper describes algorithms and simulation results.

An airspace construct – elevators – is described that minimizes the volume needed for ascent/descent, and thus maximizes the volume that can be devoted to high-throughput channelized traffic.

Technical, ecosystem, or operational factors that influence each of the mechanisms are also identified. Interdependencies between the constraints are shown. Potential approaches to reduce constraint severity through adjustments to the mechanisms are introduced. Finally, an effort is made to characterize the severity of each operational constraint as a function of the density of UAM operations in a region of interest. To this end, a measure of severity is proposed for each constraint. This measure is used to notionally display how the severity of the constraint responds to UAM scaling, and to identify scenarios where efforts to relieve the constraint are most effective.

An evaluation of this initial implementation was conducted in fast-time simulations using a dense, two-hour traffic scenario with Urban Air Mobility aircraft flying between a network of 20 vertiports in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. When the spatial separation was reduced from 0.3nmi to 0.1nmi, the total delay decreased by 7.3%; when the temporal separation was reduced from 60s to 45s, the total delay decreased by 28.4%. The total number of conflict resolutions decreased by 26% and 17%, respectively.

Air EMS can move patients or live organs more rapidly than surface modes over long distances or congested areas. Air EMS also provides unparalleled access to accident scenes in regions where surface transportation is compromised such as in the backcountry or during disaster scenarios. However, despite these unique capabilities, Air EMS is currently provided to only a small minority of the most critical medical cases. This is due to the high historical cost and risk of airborne operations. Air EMS costs are driven primarily by the high level of availability required of these services and their low utilization. The elevated accident rate compared to other forms of aviation is in large part due to the operation of these services to and from off-field landing areas with unmarked and perhaps unknown obstacles. This research investigates opportunities to increase the number of Air EMS operations provided in a region by reducing the cost per operation and increasing the level of care. Significant recent investments in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are maturing a new class of electric aircraft and automation technologies that may provide benefits to Air EMS operations. Furthermore, opportunities to deploy Air EMS assets as part of a UAM system to increase utilization and reduce costs through revenue management are also reviewed. Finally, potential pathways to leverage Air EMS as a proving ground and forcing function to overcome constraints in air traffic control and community acceptance for broader UAM services are discussed.

Fiber delamination and resin burning are the major difficulties associated with traditional machining processes of CFRP. Although dry cutting is preferable for cutting CFRP which not absorb cutting fluid and eliminate the need for subsequent cleaning, increasing cutting temperature leads to degradation, smearing, and burning of epoxy resin. This paper investigates the effect of different fluid delivery methods (MQL/flood) on ultrasonic assisted machining (UAM) of multidirectional CFRP laminates using diamond abrasive tools at different cutting conditions. The process parameters studied were cutting speed, feed rate, radial depth of cut, and cooling modes. Cutting forces, surface integrity, and bouncing-back effect were the output responses of this study. Statistical analysis was conducted to study the effect of each factor on the performance characteristics. The results showed that flood coolant provide better results than MQL. However, MQL responses still comparable with flood coolant. The conditions that gave the best responses of MQL were determined which can be utilized for near dry cutting demands. © 2018 The Authors.

Here, the effect of these amino acids on the production of CYN in cultures of the cylindrospermopsin-producing strain, Aphanizomenon ovalisporum UAM-MAO, has been studied. Arg clearly increased CYN content, the increment appearing triphasic along the culture. On the contrary, Gly caused a decrease of CYN, observable from the first day on. Interestingly, the transcript of the gene ntcA, key in nitrogen metabolism control, was also enhanced in the presence of Arg and/or Gly, the trend of the transcript oscillations being like that of aoa/cyr. The inhibitory effect of Gly in CYN production seems not to result from diminishing the activity of genes considered involved in CYN synthesis, since Gly, as Arg, enhance the transcription of genes aoaA-C and cyrJ. On the other hand, culture growth is affected by Arg and Gly in a similar way to CYN production, with Arg stimulating and Gly impairing it. Taken together, our data show that the influence of both Arg and Gly on CYN changes seems not to be due to a specific effect on the first step of CYN synthesis; it rather appears to be the result of changes in the physiological cell status. © 2017 by the authors.

As it has a great impact on the financial performance for retail stores, retailers take it as the crucial activity and the nucleus for an intelligent inventory control system. In this paper, we consider the assortment planning with substitution (a substitute product when the original choice is unavailable) under a fuzzy environment and then a fuzzy optimization model is built to obtain maximum benefits for retailers. For the fuzzy variables in the objective functions, we propose a fuzzy measure which can represent any attitudes between extremely optimistic and pessimistic to handle objective functions and get their expected value. For the constraints, a similarity relationship based on the fuzzy measure is defined, and the feasible region is addressed by the rough approximation based on this similarity relationship. Then, the lower approximation model (LAM) and the upper approximation model (UAM), which can avoid losing much information in the modeling process, are generated. To solve the model, a hybrid genetic algorithm with rough simulation is proposed. Finally, an application is used to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the model and solution algorithm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Assortment planning; Fuzzy environment; Multi-objective programming model; Rough approximation"

The main objective of paper is to assess the impact of the implicit effect, e.g., considering the effect of cross section perturbation on the self-shielding calculation, on the Doppler coefficient SA and UQ. Analyses are done for a Light Water Reactor (LWR) pin cell based on Phase I of the UAM LWR benchmark. The negligence of implicit effects in XSUSA and TSUNAMI leads to deviations of a few percent between the sensitivity profiles compared to SAMPLER and TSUNAMI (incl. implicit effects) except for 238U elastic scattering. The implicit effect is much larger for the SHARK-X calculations because of its coarser energy group structure between 10 eV and 10 keV compared to the applied SCALE libraries.

However, regulatory bodies worldwide are trending toward requiring such analyses for reactor fuel cycle calculations, which also requires uncertainty propagation for isotopics and nuclear reaction rates. XSUSA is a proven methodology for cross section uncertainty propagation based on random sampling of the nuclear data according to covariance data in multi-group representation; HELIOS2 is a lattice code widely used for commercial and research reactor fuel cycle calculations. This work describes a technique to automatically propagate the nuclear data uncertainties via the XSUSA approach through fuel lattice calculations in HELIOS2. Application of the XSUSA methodology in HELIOS2 presented some unusual challenges because of the highly-processed multi-group cross section data used in commercial lattice codes. Currently, uncertainties based on the SCALE 6.1 covariance data file are being used, but the implementation can be adapted to other covariance data in multi-group structure. Pin-cell and assembly depletion calculations, based on models described in the UAM-LWR Phase I and II benchmarks, are performed and uncertainties in multiplication factor, reaction rates, isotope concentrations, and delayed-neutron data are calculated. With this extension, it will be possible for HELIOS2 users to propagate nuclear data uncertainties directly from the microscopic cross sections to subsequent core simulations. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",

However, important differences seem to exist between men and women. Therefore, we aim to analyze EEG characteristics in a female sample. Subjects and Methods: In the current study, EEG was recorded at rest with closed eyes before and during repeated photostimulations (RPh) and before (pre) and during association of RPh with switch pressing (VM-asso) in 70 female adults. EEG was analyzed using UAM/INR software, which removes artifacts, identifies corresponding signals, selects 20 samples (2-s) from each condition, applies Welch's periodogram to calculate and average the absolute power (AP; AAPs) of δ, θ, α, and β, before and during learning, and emits data to a spreadsheet. Differences in each condition were evaluated using non-parametric tests. Results: The AAPs were different; in habituation, δ and θ increased significantly in fronto-frontal (FF) and frontocentral and decreased in the other leads. During association, they increased in FF and decreased in the other three regions, α AAP decreased in all leads except in FF during habituation, and the decrement was lower in the association, β AAP increased in all leads during both learning conditions.

The developed capability uses a two-step approach. In the first step, Uncertainties in nuclear data are propagated to two-group cross sections, diffusion coefficients, and assembly discontinuity factors. This is carried out using deterministic, perturbation-theory-based uncertainty analysis methodology. In the second step, a global covariance matrix, characterizing the uncertainties of the group constants, is formed, and the uncertainties are propagated through a full core SIMULATE calculation using a stochastic approach. This system enables the analysis of nuclear data related uncertainties in assembly-homogenized group constants, assembly discontinuity factors, and pin powers, as well as full core results such as multiplication factor and power distribution. The mathematical background of the deterministic uncertainty analysis methodology is reviewed and the main conclusions related to the implementation are summarized.

However, no previous investigation has assessed this association in older adults from Mediterranean countries, who show characteristic drinking patterns. Methods Data were taken from the UAM and the Seniors-ENRICA cohorts in Spain, comprising community-dwelling people aged ≥60 years. At baseline, participants in both cohorts were classified as non-drinkers, ex-drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers (the threshold between moderate and heavy intake was ≥40 g/day in men and ≥24 g/day in women). The Seniors-ENRICA cohort allowed assessment of a Mediterranean Drinking Pattern (MDP), defined as moderate alcohol intake, with wine preference (≥80% of alcohol consumed as wine) and drinking only with meals. The incidence of limitation in mobility, agility, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was ascertained in each cohort at the end of a 3.5-year follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, education, lifestyle, BMI, chronic conditions, and functional limitations at baseline others than the studied limitation. Results Compared with non-drinkers, ex-drinkers showed a higher risk of IADL limitation (pooled adjusted odds ratio [paOR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–2.21). By contrast, moderate drinkers had a lower risk of limitations in mobility (paOR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63–0.97), agility (paOR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.65–0.99) and IADL (paOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39–0.69). Among individuals reporting poor or fair health, the MDP was associated with lower risk of mobility limitation (aOR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27–0.97). Conclusion In older adults, moderate alcohol consumption, as well as the MDP in specific subgroups, is associated with lower risk of functional limitation. These results should not serve to promote alcohol intake, because older adults are particularly vulnerable to its harmful effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Alcohol; Cohort study; Functional limitations"

Plant mutases belong to a small gene family called Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). So far, UAM has been identified in Oryza sativa (Rice), Arabidopsis thaliana and Hordeum vulgare (Barley). The enzyme requires divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Here, the divalent metal ion dependency of UAMs from O. sativa (rice) and A. thaliana have been studied using HPLC-based kinetic assays. It was determined that UAM from these species had the highest relative activity in a range of 40–80 μM Mn2 +. Excess Mn2 + ion concentration decreased the enzyme activity. This trend was observed when other divalent metal ions were used to test activity. To gain a perspective of the role played by the metal ion in activity, an ab initio structural model was generated based on the UAM amino acid sequence and a potential metal binding region was identified. Based on our results, we propose that the probable role of the metal in UAM is stabilizing the diphosphate of the substrate, UDP-Arap. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Enzyme kinetics; L-arabinofuranose; Metalloproteins; Plant mutase; Reversibly glycosylated polypeptides; Structure prediction; UDP-arabinopyranose mutase"

For this purpose, in weak rocks and soils, the umbrella arch method (UAM) has been used in addition to the new Austrian tunneling method (NATM). NATM and UAM are the best-known classical methods used in tunnel excavation. In classical tunneling, NATM is usually preferred in normal rocks. However, in some cases, NATM may be insufficient. UAM is a very effective alternative especially in soils and weak rocks. In soil and weak rocks, UAM is especially necessary to prevent excessive deformations. Selection of UAM or NATM is based on the following factors: cost comparison of NATM and UAM, allowable deformations, quality of rock or soil, application time of NATM and UAM, availability of skilled workers, and qualification level of the workers. Therefore, selecting the excavation method in these kinds of grounds is vital in terms of achieving the project goals in time, managing the project costs effectively, and controlling the probable deformations on nearby structures. A critical issue in successful tunneling application is the ability to evaluate and predict the deformations, costs, and project time. In this paper, application times, costs, and deformation effects are compared between NATM and UAM in sensitive regions at the Uskudar-Umraniye-Cekmekoy metro project (UUCMP). Also, efficiency of the deformation control of UAM is demonstrated by using the 2D numerical analysis method. UUCMP is part of the Istanbul metro network. The tunnels have a cross section of 75.60 m2 for NATM and 83.42 m2 for UAM. Geology in this section is composed of weak sandstone. Diabase and andesite dykes are also rarely observed. This study shows that the construction cost of UAM are 1.7 times more expensive than NATM. Although application time of UAM is 2.5 times longer than NATM, it is 2.5 times more efficient in controlling the deformations. This efficiency in controlling the deformations is confirmed via two-dimensional numerical analyses. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Application time; Cost comparison; Deformation; NATM; Numerical analysis; Umbrella arch method"

It is critical that we understand the long-term effects of landscape management on the structure and composition of forest tree communities to ensure that these practices are sustainable. Furthermore, it is increasingly important to also consider effects of our management within the context of anticipated environmental changes, especially future climate. This study investigated two decades of tree community dynamics within a long-term, landscape-scale management experiment located in a temperate deciduous forest in southeastern Missouri, USA. This experiment tests three alternative landscape management systems: even-aged management (EAM), uneven-aged management (UAM), and no-harvest management (NHM). Specifically, we evaluated effects of landscape management alternatives on: (1) structural and compositional dynamics of the tree communities and (2) adaptability of the tree communities to projected climate change. Changes in the abundance of dominant species under these landscape management systems suggested a prevailing successional trend on these relatively xeric, oak-dominated landscapes. In the overstory layer, there was a decrease in the abundance of red oak species (Section Lobatae), mainly black oak (Quercus velutina Lam.) and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea Muenchh.), and an increase in white oak (Quercus alba L.) suggesting a shift to white oak dominance is underway. In the midstory and understory layers, flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) abundance declined substantially, while maples (Acer spp. L.) and several minor species increased. Declines in shortleaf pine populations indicated that regeneration harvesting is not regenerating this species. Experiment-wide changes in tree community composition suggest that adaptability to projected future climate may have increased over the first two decades of the MOFEP experiment under all management systems and that diverse management objectives can be realized through active management, including adaptation to climate change. However, future research is needed to test this working hypothesis and to more fully evaluate the impacts of silviculture treatments within the context of projected climate. © 2016","Adaptation; Climate change; Landscape management; Oak forests; Silviculture; Succession"

These methodologies have to consider the different associated regarding plant and representation uncertainties to code uncertainties. For this kind of analysis, stochastic theory developed by Wilks play a relevant role. Wilks studies are used to determine the influence of input variables on the target output variables. In addition, this method provides how many cases must be run according to the error band dimension and desired output parameters of the problem. The code DAKOTA is chosen to perform the Uncertainty and Sensitivity analysis. The most relevant input parameters are selected regarding recent research and experts criteria on the thermal-hydraulic analysis at sub-channel level. By means of the DAKOTA code, an analysis of the void fraction will be undertaken. For this work, it will be necessary to define an appropriate scenario where safety parameters, such as the void fraction, in LWR fuel bundles can be analyzed. Among the different exercises proposed in the UAM benchmark, void fraction is chosen for this work since it is an illustrative parameter related to the safety analysis. Other parameters can be evaluated in order to complete the presented methodology in future work. The chosen fuel elements are those proposed by the benchmark for Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling (UAM) and previously well defined in the PSBT and BFBT benchmarks from OECD/NEA database. The proposed benchmarks present transient scenarios in different rod array bundles providing the boundary conditions and experimental data for the physics and the scale level required in the proposed U&S analysis in this paper.

In general, most of the mould and die material are made from hardened steel (~40-60 HRc). The high strength of these materials reduced the capability of the conventional machining technique.

To overcome these problems, this paper proposed a hybrid machining process by adding an ultrasonic transducer to the normal tooling system namely ultrasonic assisted machining (UAM). Experimental work consisted of a comparison between ultrasonic assisted machining and conventional machining for different parameters namely cutting speed, feed rate and machining depth in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in improving the surface roughness value for machining hardened AISI D2 material. 2 level factorial design with 3 factors was employed as the technique of design of experiment (DOE). The machining test showed that the presence of rotary ultrasonic assisted vibration significantly improved the machined surface roughness with up to 85% reduction in Ra value compared to the conventional machining process with the same cutting conditions. In addition, the macroscopic observation of machined surface showed that the surface produced from ultrasonic machining was uniform with consistent peak to peak value which improved the surface finish. © 2017 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia.","Hardened steel; Surface roughness; Ultrasonic assisted vibration Machining"

Recently, because of the application requirements, the study on the critical dynamics behaviors of RNNs has drawn special attention. The critical condition is that a discriminant matrix M1 (Γ) related with an RNN is nonnegative definite. Due to the essential difficulty in analysis, there were only a few critical results up to now. Further, nearly all of the existing dynamic results are with diagonally nonlinear requirements on the activation mappings, i.e., the activation mapping G should satisfy the strict necessary condition that G (x) = (g1 (x1), g2 (x2), ⋯, gN (xN)) T. This is because of the essential difficulty on the analysis of the energy function. The requirement is so strict and it limits the applications of RNNs. In this paper, under the critical conditions, some new global asymptotically stable conclusions are presented for RNNs without the diagonally nonlinear requirement on the activation mappings. The results present here not only improve substantially upon the existing relevant critical stability results, but also provide some further cognizance on the essentially dynamical behavior of RNNs, and further, enlarge the application fields of them. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Neutronics calculations are in general performed over a volume-averaged temperature by ignoring this distribution. Such an assumption results in an uncertainty in reactor design parameters. In this study, the magnitude of this uncertainty is estimated by solving the heat equation with a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient coupled with a reactor physics code. The effect of radial fuel temperature distribution is investigated by representing the fuel region as multiregional. Uncertainty is investigated for various Pu contents of (U-Pu)O2 fuel, a mix of depleted U and reactor-grade Pu. The effect of Pu content on the uncertainty is studied. The PWR TMI-1 unit cell case from UAM test problems is used in the calculations. Results are obtained by using the discrete ordinate method. From the results, it was observed that uncertainties in reactor parameters (k∞ and Doppler coefficient) due to the use of no temperature gradient and in k∞ due to cross-sections decrease as Pu content increases. Moreover, it was calculated that uncertainty due to uniform temperature inside the nuclear fuel is about 7% of uncertainty due to cross-sections. © 2017 TÜBİTAK.","(U-Pu)O2 fuel; Cross-section; Doppler feedback; SCALE6; Temperature gradient; Uncertainty analysis"

Alaska has a limited taxonomic workforce to address these changes. We are building a DNA barcode library to facilitate a metabarcoding approach to monitoring non-marine arthropods. Working with the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, we obtained DNA barcodes from recently collected and authoritatively identified specimens in the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) Insect Collection and the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge collection. We submitted tissues from 4776 specimens, of which 81% yielded DNA barcodes representing 1662 species and 1788 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), of primarily terrestrial, large-bodied arthropods. This represents 84% of the species available for DNA barcoding in the UAM Insect Collection. There are now 4020 Alaskan arthropod species represented by DNA barcodes, after including all records in Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) of species that occur in Alaska-i.e., 48.5% of the 8277 Alaskan, non-marine-arthropod, named species have associated DNA barcodes. An assessment of the identification power of the library in its current state yielded fewer species-level identifications than expected, but the results were not discouraging. We believe we are the first to deliberately begin development of a DNA barcode library of the entire arthropod fauna for a North American state or province. Although far from complete, this library will become increasingly valuable as more species are added and costs to obtain DNA sequences fall. © 2017 Published by NRC Research Press.","Arthropoda; Biodiversity; DNA barcoding; Inventory; Monitoring"

In Europe Aphanizomenon gracile and Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi are the only known producers of PSP toxins and are found in Southwest and Central European freshwater bodies. In this study the PSP toxin producing Aphanizomenon sp. strain NIVA-CYA 851 was isolated from the Norwegian Lake Hillestadvannet. In a polyphasic approach NIVA-CYA 851 was morphologically and phylogenetically classified, and investigated for toxin production. The strain NIVA-CYA 851 was identified as A. gracile using 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and was confirmed to produce neosaxitoxin, saxitoxin and gonyautoxin 5 by LC-MS. The whole sxt gene clusters (circa 27.3 kb) of four A. gracile strains: NIVA-CYA 851 (Norway); NIVA-CYA 655 & NIVA-CYA 676 (Germany); and UAM 529 (Spain), all from latitudes between 40° and 59° North were sequenced and compared with the sxt gene cluster of reference strain A. gracile NH-5 from the USA. All five sxt gene clusters are highly conserved with similarities exceeding 99.4%, but they differ slightly in the number and presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (In/Dels). Altogether 178 variable sites (44 SNPs and 4 In/Dels, comprising 134 nucleotides) were found in the sxt gene clusters of the Norwegian, German and Spanish strains compared to the reference strain. Thirty-nine SNPs were located in 16 of the 27 coding regions. The sxt gene clusters of NIVA-CYA 851, NIVACYA 655, NIVA-CYA 676 and UAM 529, were characterized by 15, 16, 19 and 23 SNPs respectively. Only the Norwegian strain NIVA-CYA 851 possessed an insertion of 126 base pairs (bp) in the noncoding area between the sxtA and sxtE genes and a deletion of 6 nucleotides in the sxtN gene. The sxtI gene showed the highest variability and is recommended as the best genetic marker for further phylogenetic studies of the sxt gene cluster of A. gracile. This study confirms for the first time the role of A. gracile as a PSP toxin producer in Norwegian waters, representing the northernmost occurrence of PSP toxin producing A. gracile in Europe known so far.

Our starting point is to show that—in contrast to plain randomized communication complexity—every boolean function admits an AM communication protocol where on each yes-input, the distribution of Merlin’s proof leaks no information about the input and moreover, this proof is unique for each outcome of Arthur’s randomness. We posit that these two properties of zero information leakage and unambiguity on yes-inputs are interesting in their own right and worthy of investigation as new avenues toward AM. Zero-information protocols (ZAM): Our basic ZAM protocol uses exponential communication for some functions, and this raises the question of whether more efficient protocols exist. We prove that all functions in the classical space-bounded complexity classes NL and ⊕ L have polynomial-communication ZAM protocols. We also prove that ZAM complexity is lower bounded by conondeterministic communication complexity. Unambiguous protocols (UAM): Our most technically substantial result is a Ω (n) lower bound on the UAM complexity of the NP-complete set-intersection function; the proof uses information complexity arguments in a new, indirect way and overcomes the “zero-information barrier” described above. We also prove that in general, UAM complexity is lower bounded by the classic discrepancy bound, and we give evidence that it is not generally lower bounded by the classic corruption bound. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Arthur–Merlin communication; Unambiguity; Zero-information protocols"

Saccharification and biofuel yields are inhibited by the plant cell wall’s natural recalcitrance against enzymatic degradation. Plant hemicellulose polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans structurally support and cross-link other cell wall polymers. Grasses predominately have Type II cell walls that are abundant in arabinoxylan, which comprise nearly 25% of aboveground biomass. A primary component of arabinoxylan synthesis is uridine diphosphate (UDP) linked to arabinofuranose (Araf). A family of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM)/reversible glycosylated polypeptides catalyze the interconversion between UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-Araf. Results: The expression of a switchgrass arabinoxylan biosynthesis pathway gene, PvUAM1, was decreased via RNAi to investigate its role in cell wall recalcitrance in the feedstock. PvUAM1 encodes a switchgrass homolog of UDP-arabinose mutase, which converts UDP-Arap to UDP-Araf. Southern blot analysis revealed each transgenic line contained between one to at least seven T-DNA insertions, resulting in some cases, a 95% reduction of native PvUAM1 transcript in stem internodes. Transgenic plants had increased pigmentation in vascular tissues at nodes, but were otherwise similar in morphology to the non-transgenic control. Cell wall-associated arabinose was decreased in leaves and stems by over 50%, but there was an increase in cellulose. In addition, there was a commensurate change in arabinose side chain extension. Cell wall lignin composition was altered with a concurrent increase in lignin content and transcript abundance of lignin biosynthetic genes in mature tillers. Enzymatic saccharification efficiency was unchanged in the transgenic plants relative to the control. Conclusion: Plants with attenuated PvUAM1 transcript had increased cellulose and lignin in cell walls. A decrease in cell wall-associated arabinose was expected, which was likely caused by fewer Araf residues in the arabinoxylan. The decrease in arabinoxylan may cause a compensation response to maintain cell wall integrity by increasing cellulose and lignin biosynthesis. In cases in which increased lignin is desired, e.g., feedstocks for carbon fiber production, downregulated UAM1 coupled with altered expression of other arabinoxylan biosynthesis genes might result in even higher production of lignin in biomass. © 2016 Willis, Smith, Mazarei, Zhang, Turner, Decker, Sykes, Poovaiah, Baxter, Mann, Davis, Udvardi, Peña, Backe, Bar-Peled and Stewart.","Biofuel; Hemicellulose arabinoxylan; Recalcitrance; Switchgrass; UDP-arabinopyranose mutase/reversible glycosylated polypeptide"

The work was performed in order to improve the methods for determining the ionospheric state by vertical sounding ionograms. The time variations in the F2 layer critical frequency, electric field vector zonal component, and thermospheric wind velocity meridional component have been analyzed. Calculations were performed with three UAM variants. The UAM version providing the best agreement with the CADI ionosonde data was the version in which the neutral temperature, neutral composition, and pressure gradients are calculated according to the MSIS empirical model and the horizontal neutral wind velocity is determined by the equation of motion with pressure gradients from MSIS. The calculated values corresponded to the measurements, except those for the evening, because the electron density at the ionospheric F2 layer maximum depends more strongly on electric fields and thermospheric wind velocities during this period.

The use of a more fundamental methodology is also consistent with the reliable high fidelity physics models and robust, efficient, and accurate codes available today. To facilitate uncertainty analysis applications a comprehensive approach and methodology must be developed and applied, in contrast to the historical approach where sensitivity analysis were performed and uncertainties then determined by a simplified statistical combination of a few important input parameters. New methodologies are currently under development in the OECD/NEA Light Water Reactor (LWR) Uncertainty Analysis in Best-Estimate Modelling (UAM) benchmark activity. High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) designs require specific treatment of the double heterogeneous fuel design and large graphite quantities at high temperatures. The IAEA has therefore launched a Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on HTGR Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling (UAM) in 2013 to study uncertainty propagation specifically in the HTGR analysis chain. Two benchmark problems are defined, with the prismatic design represented by the General Atomics (GA) MHTGR-350 and a 250 MW modular pebble bed design similar to the Chinese HTR-PM. Work has started on the first phase and the current CRP status is reported in the paper. A comparison of the Serpent and SCALE/KENO-VI reference Monte Carlo results for Ex. I-1 of the MHTGR-350 design is also included. It was observed that the SCALE/KENO-VI Continuous Energy (CE) k∞ values were 395 pcm (Ex. I-1a) to 803 pcm (Ex. I-1b) higher than the respective Serpent lattice calculations, and that within the set of the SCALE results, the KENO-VI 238 Multi-Group (MG) k∞ values were up to 800 pcm lower than the KENO-VI CE values. The use of the latest ENDF-B-VII.1 cross section library in Serpent lead to ∼180 pcm lower k∞ values compared to the older ENDF-B-VII.0 dataset, caused by the modified graphite neutron capture cross section. The fourth beta release of SCALE 6.2 likewise produced lower CE k∞ values when compared to SCALE 6.1, and the improved performance of the new 252-group library available in SCALE 6.2 is especially noteworthy.

This study assessed the association between the Mediterranean diet and HRQL in 2 prospective cohorts of individuals aged ≥60 years in Spain. Methods: The UAM-cohort (n = 2376) was selected in 2000/2001 and followed-up through 2003. At baseline, diet was collected with a food frequency questionnaire, which was used to develop an 8-item index of Mediterranean diet (UAM-MDP). The Seniors-ENRICA cohort (n = 1911) was recruited in 2008/2010 and followed-up through 2012. At baseline, a diet history was used to obtain food consumption. Mediterranean diet adherence was measured with the PREDIMED score and the Trichopoulou's Mediterranean Diet Score (MSD). HRQL was assessed, at baseline and at the end of follow-up, with the physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS) of the SF-36 questionnaire in the UAM-cohort, and the SF-12v.2 questionnaire in the Seniors-ENRICA cohort. Analyses were conducted with linear regression, and adjusted for the main confounders including baseline HRQL. Results: In the UAM-cohort, no significant associations between the UAM-MDP and the PCS or the MCS were found. In the Seniors-ENRICA cohort, a higher PREDIMED score was associated with a slightly better PCS; when compared with the lowest tertile of PREDIMED score, the beta coefficient (95% confidence interval) for PCS was 0.55 (-0.48 to 1.59) in the second tertile, and 1.34 (0.21 to 2.47) in the highest tertile. However, the PREDIMED score was non-significantly associated with a better MCS score. The MSD did not show an association with either the PCS or the MCS.

However, the engineered tissue transparency is low due to the translucent thick underlying AM stroma. To overcome this drawback, we developed an ultra-thin AM (UAM) by using collagenase IV to strip away from the epithelial denuded AM (DAM) some of the stroma. By thinning the stroma to about 30 Î 1/4m, its moist and dry forms were rendered acellular, optically clear and its collagen framework became compacted and inerratic. Engineered rabbit corneal epithelial cell (RCEC) sheets generated through expansion of limbal epithelial cells on UAM were more transparent and thicker than those expanded on DAM. Moreover, Î ""Np63 and ABCG2 gene expression was greater in tissue engineered cell sheets expanded on UAM than on DAM. Furthermore, 2 weeks after surgery, the cornea grafted with UAM based cell sheets showed higher transparency and more stratified epithelium than the cornea grafted with DAM based cell sheets. Taken together, tissue engineered corneal epithelium generated on UAM has a preferable outcome because the transplanted tissue is more transparent and better resembles the phenotype of the native tissue than that obtained by using DAM for this procedure.

When the genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, the corresponding HvUAM1, HvUAM2, and HvUAM3 proteins exhibit UAM activity, and the kinetic properties of the enzymes have been determined, including Km, Kcat, and catalytic efficiencies. However, the expressed HvUAM4 protein shows no mutase activity against UDP-Ara or against a broad range of other nucleotide sugars and related molecules. The enzymic data indicate therefore that the HvUAM4 protein may not be a mutase. However, the HvUAM4 gene is transcribed at high levels in all the barley tissues examined, and its transcript abundance is correlated with transcript levels for other genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. The UDP-l-Arap → UDP-l-Araf reaction, which is essential for the generation of the UDP-Araf substrate for arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan protein, and pectic polysaccharide biosynthesis, is thermodynamically unfavorable and has an equilibrium constant of 0.02. Nevertheless, the incorporation of Araf residues into nascent polysaccharides clearly occurs at biologically appropriate rates. The characterization of the HvUAM genes opens the way for the manipulation of both the amounts and fine structures of heteroxylans in cereals, grasses, and other crop plants, with a view toward enhancing their value in human health and nutrition, and in renewable biofuel production. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",

As an example, we have investigated the sensitivity of the radial power distribution in the core to the nature of the reflector (conventional vs. a “heavy” stainless-steel one). This was done by applying a perturbation to some peripheral assemblies of the UAM GEN-III benchmark with a fresh fuel core. The perturbation was selected to simulate possible assembly bowing effects, causing a variation of the inter-assembly water gap, which can generate an azimuthal asymmetry in the power distribution. This is conventionally referred to as a ‘power tilt’. The amplification effect of the reflector on the power tilt for fresh fuel has been addressed in two steps. Firstly, we have compared the power tilt, computed with the deterministic code CRONOS2 (the neutronics diffusion module of the HEMERA chain) to that found with the probabilistic transport code MCNP, so as to validate the CRONOS2 response against a Monte Carlo reference and also obtain a quantification of the amplification effect at zero power. Then the thermal feedback and burn-up effects have been accounted for in the diffusion calculations so as to evaluate the sensitivity of the power tilt to the reactor operating conditions. The difference in the behavior of the cores with a conventional and a heavy reflector has been investigated through the examination of the power distributions and the dominance ratio of the systems, as well as of the assembly-wise infinite multiplication factors. Whilst the results help to explain the higher sensitivity to a peripheral perturbation of a fresh fuel heavy-reflected core compared to a conventionally-reflected one, they do not enable fully comprehensive conclusions to be drawn, especially towards End Of Cycle, due to the model assumptions and the limitation in the eigenvalue expansion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Eigenvalue splitting; GEN-III core; Power tilt; Sensitivity"

It is important to methodically propagate uncertainty through the modeling process to learn the downstream physics better as well as provide margins for the designers. Currently, methods based on sampling and perturbation theory are widely used in this area. The research here demonstrates the methods developed with the SCALE and PARCS code systems and its application to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) benchmark exercise 1-3. The uncertainty from nuclear input is sampled by SCALE/Sampler to generate perturbed libraries, and the perturbed library files are used for SCALE/POLARIS to perform lattice analysis and prepare cross section files for PARCS. Statistical analysis is then performed on PARCS results to determine the mean and standard deviation values on the core design parameters such as keff and power peaking factor. Using this methodology, the uncertainty from nuclear data input is propagated through the core design process, in this work, the reactor studied is the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor. The uncertainty of the keff for this reactor was found to be about 500 pcm. For power distributions, it was found that this reactor had an axial power distribution that was not very sensitive to the nuclear input uncertainties and a radial power distribution with higher uncertainties on the inner region of the core.","PARCS; POLARIS; Sampler; SCALE; Uncertainty"

It is expected that for the HTGR UAM benchmark, some of the unique features of HTGRs (the coated particle fuel, higher operating temperature, and large mass of graphite) will result in some unique aspects to be identified in the uncertainty calculations. This paper represents the uncertainty result in the multiplication factor due to the covariance matrices for Exercise 1-1 (cell calculation) of Phase I (local neutronics) of the prismatic HTGR design. It contains four sub cases with two hexagonal and two triangular unit cell models defined to be at two operating conditions (293K and 1200K). Each of the models has a homogenous case where the TRISO particles are smeared in the graphite matrix, and a case where the fuel particles are explicitly modelled within the fuel compact. The latest version of SCALE6.1.3/TSUNAMI cannot perform the UA/SA studies for double-heterogeneous systems (as models using the application of the DOUBLEHET cell treatment) and therefore the Reactivity-Equivalent Physical Transformation (RPT) method is introduced as an approximate model in these uncertainty analyses.

The COBAYA diffusion code, coupled with COBRA-TF thermal-hydraulic code, have been applied to perform the simulations, with random boundary conditions and properties generated using the DAKOTA uncertainty and sensitivity analysis tool.

Three types of uncertainties affecting the predictions of power distribution in the core of a nuclear reactor are discussed: the uncertainties of basic nuclear data, the uncertainties resulting from the use of different simulation tools and those due to approximations in reflector modelling. The contribution of nuclear data uncertainty on the power distribution of a UOX and a MOX core is assessed with the XSUSA tool. Overall, the results obtained with different tools in both institutions are in good agreement, showing that the power distribution uncertainty due to the use of different simulation tools is much lower than the one due to nuclear data, which is a large contributor.

Here, we address this problem by developing a new meanfield substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that themost variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The meanfield models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitutionmodel assigns larger likelihood than the empiricalmodel to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence.

We also evaluated the correlation between mast cell tryptase and CD31 expression to clarify the role of mast cells (MCs) in the growth of odontogenic tumors. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-MC tryptase and anti-CD31 antibodies was performed on 48 cases of odontogenic tumors including solid ameloblastoma (SAM), unicystic ameloblastoma (UAM), odontogenic myxoma (OM), cystic calcifying odontogenic tumor (CCOT) and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT). Ten high power fields were analyzed for each sample. Total MC count was significantly increased in SAM compared to other odontogenic tumors (p < 0.05). Microvessel density was statistically higher in SAM and AOT compared to remaining odontogenic tumors (p < 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between MCs and microvessels in odontogenic tumors (p = 0.018, r = 0.34). Our findings suggest a role for MCs in aggressive clinical behavior of odontogenic tumors. The significant correlation found between MC count and microvessel density in odontogenic tumors is in agreement with the theory of participation of MCs in tumor progression.

The classical ERP-based speller, or P300 Speller, is one of the most commonly used paradigms in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Several alterations to the visual stimuli presentation system have been developed to avoid unfavorable effects elicited by adjacent stimuli. However, there has been little, if any, regard to useful information contained in responses to adjacent stimuli about spatial location of target symbols. This paper aims to demonstrate that combining the classification of non-target adjacent stimuli with standard classification (target versus non-target) significantly improves classical ERP-based speller efficiency. Approach. Four SWLDA classifiers were trained and combined with the standard classifier: the lower row, upper row, right column and left column classifiers. This new feature extraction procedure and the classification method were carried out on three open databases: the UAM P300 database (Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico), BCI competition II (dataset IIb) and BCI competition III (dataset II). Main results. The inclusion of the classification of non-target adjacent stimuli improves target classification in the classical row/column paradigm. A gain in mean single trial classification of 9.6% and an overall improvement of 25% in simulated spelling speed was achieved. Significance. We have provided further evidence that the ERPs produced by adjacent stimuli present discriminable features, which could provide additional information about the spatial location of intended symbols.

Several different approaches have been suggested to combine the responses of DMs into a compromise or consensus ranking from a diverse perspective. These methods either fuse basic rankings in a simple average way or suffer from high complexity to prevent themselves from conducting large-scale rankings. In light of this, we propose a new model for consensus ranking with a union adjacency matrix (UAM), which summarizes the ranking information of each pair in basic rankings. By this means, we transfer the consensus ranking problem (CRP) into a graph ranking problem (GRP) and take PageRank algorithm to achieve the consensus solution. Compared with traditional methods, it can deal with the expert weight, sequence absence and difference quantization problems. As demonstrated in the experiment, our model not only has high efficiency and good effectiveness, but also enjoys good stability and scalability.

However, to date what has not been examined is the change in aggregate morphology during milling itself, i.e. it is not clear if wet milling simply fragments aggregates into smaller, similarly structured entities, or if milling can simultaneously lead to aggregate restructuring. Here we develop and apply methods to examine the change in morphology in titania and alumina nanoparticle aggregates (primary particle radii of ~. 8.25. nm and 7.20. nm, respectively) during wet milling with a Kotobuki Industries UAM-015 wet mill. Specifically, via nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with a Nanosight LM-14 and simultaneous viscosity measurements, we characterized the hydrodynamic radius distribution functions and average intrinsic viscosities of both titania and alumina aggregates milled at 1% volume fraction in water. With NTA we found that for both particle types, milling led to a reduction in hydrodynamic radii. Conversely, the average intrinsic viscosity of titania decreased, while it increased for alumina with increasing milling time. By assuming aggregates were quasifractal in morphology (and hence characterized by the number of primary per particles per aggregate, the pre-exponential factor, and the fractal dimension) and by using Monte Carlo based techniques to link quasifractal aggregate descriptors to both the hydrodynamic radius and the intrinsic viscosity for an aggregate, measured hydrodynamic radius distribution functions and average intrinsic viscosities were used to infer titania and alumina aggregate quasifractal descriptors as functions of milling time. Through this analysis we found that both particle types were initially dense aggregates (fractal dimensions >. 2.9), and for titania milling did not alter aggregate morphology (i.e. titania aggregates remained dense). However, alumina aggregates were found to decrease in fractal dimension with increasing milling time, reaching a value near 1.6 after 180. minutes of milling. Such chain-like structures give rise to an increase in suspension viscosity despite the fact that alumina aggregate size decreased with milling. Overall, we show that depending on the particle material (and surfactant employed), milling may simultaneously lead to aggregate size reduction and restructuring, and may be a viable approach to the production of controlled morphology aggregates. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregates; Bead milling; Communition; Nanoparticles; Quasifractals"

This paper indicates the importance of using digital recordkeeping metadata to meet more precisely and at the same time semi-automatically the criteria set by memory institutions. The paper provides an overview of one prospective solution and describes the Estonian National Archives’ universal archiving module (UAM). A case study reports the use of the UAM in preserving the digital records of the Estonian Minister for Population and Ethnic Affairs. In this project, the preparation and transfer of archival records was divided into ten phases, starting from the description of the archival creator and ending with controlled transfer. The case study raises questions about how much recordkeeping metadata can be used in archival description and how the interaction of the agency’s ERMS and ingest by the archives could be more automated. The main issues (e.g. classification, metadata elements variations, mapping, and computer files conversions) encountered during that project are discussed. Findings show that the Open Archival Information System functional model’s ingest part should be reconceptualised to take into account preparatory work. Adding detailed metadata about the structure, context and relationships in the right place at the right time could get one step closer to digital codified knowledge archiving by creating synergies with various other digital repositories. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Digital preservation; Estonia; Ingest; Pre-ingest; Universal archiving module"

Methods: Twenty patients (12 M, 8 F; mean: 42.6±18.5 years old) who were candidates for surgery or intervention because of unilateral hydronephrosis were the subjects of this study. All the patients were evaluated by Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy before and 3-6 months after the intervention.

Bland-Altman analyses were performed in order to compare the DRF values obtained from both methods. Results: The agreement between CM and UAM was poor in the preoperative estimation, however, the agreement was good after the operation or intervention.

It is found predominantly in the furanose form rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. UDPL-Arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf ), rather than UDP-L-Arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap), is a sugar donor for the biosynthesis of arabinofuranosyl (Araf ) residues. UDP-Arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs) have been shown to interconvert UDPAraf and UDP-Arap and are involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides including Araf. The UAM gene family has three members in Oryza sativa. Co-expression network in silico analysis showed that OsUAM3 expression was independent from OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 co-expression networks. OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 were expressed ubiquitously throughout plant development, but OsUAM3 was expressed primarily in reproductive tissue, particularly at the pollen cell wall formation developmental stage. OsUAM3 coexpression networks include pectin catabolic enzymes. To determine the function of OsUAMs in reproductive tissues, we analyzed RNA interference (RNAi)-knockdown transformants (OsUAM3-KD) specific for OsUAM3. OsUAM3-KD plants grew normally and showed abnormal phenotypes in reproductive tissues, especially in terms of the pollen cell wall and exine. In addition, we examined modifications of cell wall polysaccharides at the cellular level using antibodies against polysaccharides including Araf. Immunolocalization of arabinan using the LM6 antibody showed low levels of arabinan in OsUAM3-KD pollen grains. Our results suggest that the function of OsUAM3 is important for synthesis of arabinan side chains of RG-I and is required for reproductive developmental processes, especially the formation of the cell wall in pollen. © The Author 2014.

The codes used for this study were the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) version of the thermal hydraulic subchannel code COBRA-TF (COolant Boiling in Rod Array - Two Fluid) and the statistical analysis tool Dakota (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) from Sandia National Laboratories. Four steady state cases and one transient case arc included from Phase II, Exercise 3 of the UAM Benchmark. A large variety of output parameters are analyzed for each test case: maximum void fraction, maximum fuel temperature, maximum cladding temperature, bundle pressure drop, a variety of axial distributions for a central subchannel, and the radial distribution of void fraction at the exit of the assembly. The predicted uncertainty in all parameters is low for all cases. The dominant sources of uncertainty arc inferred from rank correlation coefficients between the input and output parameters. The results agree well with similar past studies, but using a different method for sample size selection and the newest versions of the UAM benchmark and COBRA-TF. This study makes the following contributions to the existing literature: An analysis of the axial development of sensitivity information, the inclusion of a transient case, and an in-depth analysis of the geometry uncertainty treatment suggested by the UAM benchmark. Recommendations for future work are made, with an emphasis on the importance of a quantitative method for determination of the modeling parameter uncertainties.","COBRA-TF; Dakota; Subchannel codes; Thermal hydraulics; Uncertainty analysis"

In this work, we have studied the probiotic or health-beneficial potential of 130 yeast strains isolated from food belonging to the collection of the Institute of Food Science Research CIAL (CSIC-UAM). To that end, the response of these yeasts to physiological conditions during consumption has been assessed through measuring their capacity to grow at 37 °C and to survive the gastrointestinal transit conditions. Almost 50% of the yeast analysed could thrive at the host intestine temperature, and of these, almost 37% had growth kinetic parameters higher at 37 °C than at 25 °C. In addition, about 95% of the strains could survive the exposition to conditions simulating the gastrointestinal transit. The yeast strains were also analysed for exhibiting auto-aggregation phenotype, antioxidant activity and the production of killer peptides, this only found in 8.5% of the strains analysed.

Changes in GAA can affect the nervous system and induce hyperhomocysteinemia, representing a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In cyanobacteria, GAA is thought to be an intermediate in the synthesis of the toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN), one of the most common known cyanotoxins that affects multiple organs and functions in animals and plants. In spite of the evidence supporting GAA toxicity and its role in CYN synthesis, no data have been reported on the accumulation of GAA in any cyanobacterium. We have analyzed and compared the content of GAA in cultures of diverse cyanobacteria types, both cylindrospermopsin producing (CYN+) and not producing (CYN-). The results obtained show that GAA accumulates in the majority of the strains tested, although the highest content was found in one of the CYN+ strain, Aphanizomenon ovalisporum UAM-MAO. In this strain, both GAA and CYN can be located within and out the cells.

Most methods fall into the two broad classes of Monte Carlo approaches, which are exact apart from statistical uncertainties but require additional computation time, and first order perturbation theory approaches, which are efficient for not too large numbers of considered response functions but only applicable for sufficiently small nuclear data uncertainties. Some methods neglect isotopic composition uncertainties induced by the depletion steps of the simulations, others neglect neutron flux uncertainties, and the accuracy of a given approximation is often very hard to quantify. In order to get a better sense of the impact of different approximations, this work aims to compare results obtained based on different approximate methodologies with an exact method, namely the NUDUNA Monte Carlo based approach developed by AREVA GmbH. In addition, the impact of different covariance data is studied by comparing two of the presently most complete nuclear data covariance libraries (ENDF/B-VII.1 and SCALE 6.0), which reveals a high dependency of the uncertainty estimates on the source of covariance data.

Existing SS-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of propagating uncertainties in multigroup nuclear data. However, in fields such as criticality safety assessment, pointwise representation of nuclear data is more appropriate in order to corroborate the increasing safety demand and best-estimate modeling capabilities. In this work, an SS-based tool, called NUSS is implemented which perturbs pointwise ACE-formatted nuclear data using multigroup nuclear data covariance. The use of pointwise ACE-formatted nuclear data in NUSS can accommodate flexible multigroup covariance structures and allows for nuclear data uncertainty propagation through the continuous/pointwise-energy transport code MCNPX. As a first step of the NUSS development and verification, uncertainty contributions from 239Pu and 235U nuclear data were assessed for Jezebel (Pu-fueled) and Godiva (U-fueled) fast-spectrum criticality benchmarks.

However, there are several species that use a hygrochastic strategy: spores are dispersed when conditions are wet. The significance of this strategy in the Mediterranean region is unknown. In this study, we explored whether ultrastructural features related to differences in spore resistance may explain these different strategies of spore dispersal. To this end, we examined the ultrastructural features of the spores of seven closely related species in the moss genus Orthotrichum. These species all grow as epiphytes in sub-Mediterranean forests, and the group includes both xerochastic and hygrochastic members. First, we found that the spore wall layers exhibit several features previously undescribed in mosses. Second, we discovered that there are only subtle differences in spore ultrastructure with regards to spore wall thickness, the degree of plastid development, or the storage substances used. We suggest that the hygrochastic dispersal in mosses from Mediterranean environments might be related to a safe-site strategy, rather than to drought avoidance, and we underscore the necessity of conducting spore ultrastructural studies on a greater number of bryophyte species. 2014 Medina Esté banez.

The first version of the C-IAM is comprised of the extended Canadian Middle Atmosphere (CMAM) and the Murmansk's Upper Atmosphere Model (UAM), currently coupled in a one-way manner. The model extends from the surface to the inner magnetosphere and is able to describe the impact on the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of self-consistently generated lower atmosphere dynamical variability. In the current study, the C-IAM has been used to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for forming the 4-peak longitudinal structure of the 135.6. nm ionospheric emission observed by the IMAGE satellite over the tropics at 20:00 local time from March 20 to April 20, 2002. To perform this study, the C-IAM has been run for this whole observation period taking into account a realistic day-to-day variation in solar and geomagnetic activity. The 4-peak longitudinal structure produced by the model and averaged over the observation period is in a good agreement with the observations. Analysis of the model results suggests that the main mechanism for generating the longitudinal structure in the ionospheric emission after sunset is a modification of the ionospheric electric field in the E region caused in the course of the daytime by differences in the diurnal evolution of the zonal wind in different longitudinal sectors due to waves penetrating from the lower atmosphere. In agreement with the earlier findings, our study showed that this mechanism is driven mainly by the diurnal eastward propagating tide with zonal number 3. A small contribution to the formation of the 4-peak structure is also provided by longitudinal variations in meridional wind and neutral composition at the F2 layer altitudes. The 4 peaks being clearly visible in the monthly mean result are not, however, present every day. Day-to-day variability of both the diurnal wind evolution and geomagnetic activity can significantly modify the longitudinal structure of the ionospheric emission. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmosphere-ionosphere coupling; Ionospheric emission; Whole atmosphere modeling"

In this study, nuclear data uncertainties have been propagated to LWR cores using accurate transport calculations. PWR benchmarks representative of the French NPP fleet were selected: one 900MWe (Fessenheim), one 1500MWe (CHOOZ), as two complementary GEN-III benchmarks belonging to the OECD/UAM benchmark, representative of large PWR UOX and partially loaded-MOX cores surrounded by thick stainless steel reflector. Reactivity and assembly power map sensitivity coefficients to multigroup cross sections have been calculated using perturbation theory tools implemented in ERANOS2/SNATCH transport code. Different sources of nuclear data uncertainty were compared: covariance matrices from BOLNA, and French COMAC associated to JEFF3.1.1 evaluations, were used for uncertainty propagation. The total uncertainty on the multiplication factor keff is not sensitive to the size and the loading of the PWR cores; this uncertainty amounts to 560pcm (1s) with COMAC, compared to 780 pcm with BOLNA covariances. The main component of keff uncertainty is U235, followed by 238U capture, sc U235 and sf U235. The uncertainty on the radial power map increases with the core size, due to higher Eigen Value Separation factor (EVS>20). For example, using COMAC covariances, the uncertainty in central assemblies increases from 1.5% for PWR-900MWe to 3.4% for large N4 and GEN-III PWRs. In the peripheral assemblies which can host the power peak, the uncertainty increases from 1.1% for 900MWe to 2% for large PWRs. Therefore, the potential power swing bias in JEFF3.1.1 core calculations varies from 2.6% for PWR-900MWe to 5-6% for N4 and large GEN-III PWRs. Using BOLNA covariance files, the uncertainty on the Pcentre/Pperiph power ratio amounts to 10% (5% with COMAC) for GEN-III PWR core, and up to 24% in the Gen-III MOX benchmark (12% with COMAC). Our powerful deterministic calculation scheme allowed the decomposition of the LWR parameter uncertainty in isotopic partial cross-section components. The main contributor to the power uncertainty is the 238U inelastic scattering: 3% and 5%, respectively for COMAC and BOLNA, in GEN-III central assemblies. However, 16O and 1H elastic scattering cross-sections should be also validated and improved in order to reduce their individual 1%-2% current contribution to the central power uncertainty. © Proceedings of the International Conference on Physics of Reactors, PHYSOR 2014.

Reference systems and scenarios for coupled code analysis are defined to study the uncertainty effects for all stages of the system calculations. Measured data from plant operation are available for the chosen scenarios. The general frame of the OECD/NEA UAM LWR benchmark consists of three phases with different exercises for each phase. This paper summarizes the benchmark activity and discusses the status of each phase and exercise. Selected results are shown to illustrate the technical approach in defining different exercises and findings from benchmark analysis. For the first time this benchmarks aims to determine the uncertainty in LWR system calculations at all stages of a coupled reactor physics/thermal-hydraulics/fuel performance calculation. The full chain of uncertainty propagation from basic data, engineering uncertainties, across different scales (multi-scale), and physics phenomena (multi-physics) are tested on a number of benchmark exercises for which experimental data are available and for which the power plant details have been released. As part of this effort, the development and assessment of different methods or techniques to account for the uncertainties in the calculations are investigated and reported, which contributes to the state-of-The-Art in this area. © Proceedings of the International Conference on Physics of Reactors, PHYSOR 2014.

The developed cal-culation system enables the uncertainty analysis of homogenized multi-group cross-sections, diffusion coefficients and pin powers with respect to nuclear data. The uncertainty analysis methodology is deterministic, meaning that the sensitivity profiles of the responses are com-puted first, after which uncertainty is propagated by combining the sensitivity profiles with the covariance matrices of the uncertain nuclear data. The sensitivity analysis is based on per-turbation theory which enables computing the sensitivity profiles efficiently by solving one generalized adjoint system for each response. The mathematical background of this work is reviewed and the main conclusions related to the implementation are summarized. Special emphasis is placed on the sensitivity analysis of two-group homogenized diffusion coefficients which require some modifications to the standard equations of generalized perturbation theory. Numerical results are presented and analyzed for a PWR fuel assembly with control rods out and inserted. The computational efficiency of the calculations is discussed. © 2014 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC. All Rights Reserved.","Perturbation theory; Sensitivity analysis; UAM; Uncertainty analysis"

One of the nuclear data needs to this prediction is the independent fission yields. The mostly used general-purpose evaluated nuclear data libraries provide these data including their uncertainties as standard deviation, with no-correlation between fission yields. However, new developments in the theory and measurements of fission product yields are expected to result in new evaluated files in the next coming years. These files will include considerably more accurate yields including neutron energy dependence combined with new covariance information allowing realistic uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we focused on the effect of fission yield covariance information on criticality and depletion calculations. A LWR pin-cell burn-up benchmark, proposed in the general framework of the OECD/UAM Benchmark is analyzed to address the impact of independent fission yield uncertainties. Calculations were performed with the SCALE6 system and the ENDF/B-VII.1 fission yield data library, adding covariance data obtained from including covariance info of mass yields. Results are compared with those obtained with the uncertainty data currently provided by ENDF/B-VII.1.

Since 1928, and approximately every 14 years, earthquake events have happened in this area known as the Ometepec Segment in the Mexican subduction zone.Structural damage is strongly related to economic situation. The lack of expert advice, on how to improve structural configuration utilizing local available materials and minimizing costs, left several damaged houses with highly inadequate retrofits. However, we could observe in damage recognition in recent earthquakes that the construction practice has improved, despite local and state seismic provisions; the affected population has learned the lessons of having houses with poor adobe blocks, or poor structural configurations. Seismic vulnerability studies conducted in El Salvador, in Central America, have also demonstrated that this seismic evolution is a current activity in countries with high seismic activity. The objective of the reconnaissance team of the Structures Area, of the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana (UAM-A), has always been to recognize the cause of damage to structures, in the epicentral areas that happened in Mexico; as well as let the structural engineering community know about the lessons learned from these earthquakes. In this paper we discuss that in rural communities is less frequent the use of Adobe Structures, they have improved the construction practice by replacing adobe with confined masonry structures, and hence improving their seismic behaviour. We also discuss how the seismic vulnerability in these areas has been reduced through years and earthquakes.","Masonry; Seimic vulnerability assessment; UAM-A Reconaissance team"

UAM objectives include among others, the quantification of uncertainties of neutronic calculations with respect to their value for the multi-physics analysis. Since the kinetics parameters and their uncertainties are of particular interest for these studies the deterministic approaches for analysis of uncertainties in nuclear reactor kinetic parameters (neutron generation lifetime and delayed neutron effective fraction) have been developed in frame of the UAM-LWR. The approach uses combination of generalization of perturbation theory to reactivity analysis, and the Generalized Perturbation Theory (GPT) for sensitivity computation. It has been applied to the UAM complementary fast neutron SNEAK test case that has unique set of experimental data for βeff. In this example, the covariance matrices of nuclear data have been derived from COMMARA library by Bayesian adjustment upon the set of the fast neutron integral benchmarks with the BERING code package. Then, the kinetic parameters uncertainties with their correlations have been applied to simplified model of a reactivity insertion transient where relative uncertainty of power peak was taken as figure of merit. The results demonstrate that the uncertainties due to nuclear data impact significantly the energy release in a coupled transient modeling. It was also found that such uncertainties become higher if the correlations between uncertainties of different lumped parameters are taken into account. © 2014 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.

As an example, we have investigated the sensitivity of the core radial power distribution to the nature of the reflector (conventional vs. a “heavy” stainless-steel one), by applying a perturbation to some peripheral assemblies of an EPR-like reactor system (as defined in the UAM GEN-III benchmark, a fresh fuel core). The perturbation was selected to simulate possible assembly bowing effects, engendering a variation of the inter-assembly water gap, which can generate an azimuthal asymmetry in the power distribution. This is conventionally referred to as a 'power tilt'. The amplification effect of the reflector on the power tilt has been addressed in two steps. Firstly, we have compared the power tilt, computed with the deterministic code CRONOS2 (the neutronics diffusion module of the HEMERA chain) and with the probabilistic transport code MCNP, to validate the CRONOS2 response against a Monte-Carlo reference and obtain a quantification of the amplification effect at zero power. Then the feedbacks have been taken into account in the diffusion calculations to evaluate the sensitivity of the tilt to the power level. The explanation of the difference in the core behavior in the presence of either a conventional or a heavy reflector has been investigated through the examination of the power distributions and the eigenvalue splitting of the two systems. The results explain the higher sensitivity to a peripheral perturbation of a heavy-reflector-core compared to a conventionally-reflected one. © 2014 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.

Although the TPM is designed to prevent software attacks, the TPM itself is vulnerable to physical attacks that could enable intruders to gain access to confidential data. In general, the TPM provides an ID and implements a password identification technique to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the TPM. The TPM user authentication is carried out by the TPM itself, which exposes the TPM to direct risk as highly skilled intruders can break the authentication line of defence and gain access to the TPM. The process of encrypting and decrypting information, especially when asymmetric algorithms are used, is viewed as a process that consumes time and resources, which decreases the speed of the computer. In order to solve the problems, a TPM User Authentication Model (TPM-UAM) that can provide the TPM with a higher level of security and resistance against physical attacks has been proposed as we proposed in our previous research paper (Alshar'e et al., 2014). The technique is based on biometric authentication to prove the identity of the users and to allow the process of authentication to happen at an independent platform using virtualization that will keep the TPM out of reach until a user is completely verified and approved. The TPM-UAM is able to provide a more satisfactory level of confidence for data and processes that can be rated as highly confidential and private. The model was successfully developed and tested and the results confirmed the model efficiency and ability to secure TPM and all functions have been confirmed to be working perfectly according to what they were designed for. This paper describes the design and implementation of TPM-UAM system based on the proposed authentication model, virtualization has been implemented to create authentication platform to prevent direct interaction with TPM and biometrics has been implemented to verify identities and supervise running TPM, the system testing results in confirming the system functionality and ability to secure and protect TPM. © 2014 M.I.

It is observed that the mean value of the fuel maximum temperature slightly increases with burnup and that the standard deviation and its variation remain relatively small. In a second part, a global sensitivity analysis method based on Sobol indices is applied in an attempt to estimate the relative contributions of the various input parameters to the fuel temperature uncertainty. It is found that the uncertainty is essentially dependent on the pellet-gap behavior.

A common strategy for performing lattice physics uncertainty analysis involves starting with nuclear data and covariance matrix which is typically available at infinite dilution. To describe the uncertainty of all multigroup physics parameters-including those at finite dilution - additional calculations must be performed that relate uncertainties in an infinite dilution cross-section to those at the problem dilution. Two potential methods for propagating dilution - related uncertainties were studied in this work. The first assumed a correlation between continuous-energy and multigroup cross-sectional data and uncertainties, which is convenient for direct implementation in lattice physics codes. The second is based on a more rigorous approach involving the Monte Carlo sampling of resonance parameters in evaluated nuclear data using the TALYS software. When applied to a light water fuel cell, the two approaches show significant differences, indicating that the assumption of the first method did not capture the complexity of physics parameter data uncertainties. It was found that the covariance of problem-dilution multigroup parameters for selected neutron cross-sections can vary significantly from their infinite-dilution counterparts. Copyright © 2014 M. R.

Anaesthesia care in developed countries involves sophisticated technology and experienced providers. However, advanced machines may be inoperable or fail frequently when placed into the austere medical environment of a developing country. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a method for engaging local staff in identifying real or potential breakdowns in processes or work systems and to develop strategies to mitigate risks. Methods. Nurse anaesthetists from the two tertiary care hospitals in Freetown, Sierra Leone, participated in three sessions moderated by a human factors specialist and an anaesthesiologist. Sessions were audio recorded, and group discussion graphically mapped by the session facilitator for analysis and commentary. These sessions sought to identify potential barriers to implementing an anaesthesia machine designed for austere medical environments-the universal anaesthesia machine (UAM)-and also engaging local nurse anaesthetists in identifying potential solutions to these barriers. Results. Participating Sierra Leonean clinicians identified five main categories of failure modes (resource availability, environmental issues, staff knowledge and attitudes, and workload and staffing issues) and four categories of mitigation strategies (resource management plans, engaging and educating stakeholders, peer support for new machine use, and collectively advocating for needed resources). Conclusions. We identified factors that may limit the impact of a UAM and devised likely effective strategies for mitigating those risks. © The Author 2014.","Austere anaesthesia; Failure mode and effects analysis FMEA; Quality improvement; Sierra Leone"

This study was focused on the nominal localized stand-alone fuel thermal response, as defined in Ex. 1-3 and 1-4 of the HTR UAM. The aim of the stand-alone thermal unit-cell simulation is to isolate the effect of material and boundary input uncertainties on a very simplified problem, before propagation of these uncertainties are performed in subsequent coupled neutronics/thermal fluids phases on the benchmark. In many of the previous studies for high temperature gas cooled reactors, the volume-averaged homogeneous mixture model of a single fuel compact has been applied. In the homogeneous model, the Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles in the fuel compact were not modeled directly and an effective thermal conductivity was employed for the thermo-physical properties of the fuel compact. On the contrary, in the heterogeneous model, the uranium carbide (UCO), inner and outer pyrolytic carbon (IPyC/OPyC) and silicon carbide (SiC) layers of the TRISO fuel particles are explicitly modeled. The fuel compact is modeled as a heterogeneous mixture of TRISO fuel kernels embedded in H-451 matrix graphite. In this study, a steady-state and transient CFD simulations were performed with both homogeneous and heterogeneous models to compare the thermal characteristics. The nominal values of the input parameters are used for this CFD analysis.

TPM is designed to prevent software attacks with minimal consideration being given toward physical attacks. Therefore, TPM focus on PIN password identification to control the physical presence of a user. The PIN Password method is not the ideal user verification method. Evil Maid is one of the attacking methods where a piece of code can be loaded and hidden in the boot loader before loading TPM. The code will then collects confidential information at the next boot and store it or send it to attackers via the network. In order to solve this problem, a number of solutions have been proposed.
