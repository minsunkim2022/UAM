However, there are several species that use a hygrochastic strategy: spores are dispersed when conditions are wet. The significance of this strategy in the Mediterranean region is unknown. In this study, we explored whether ultrastructural features related to differences in spore resistance may explain these different strategies of spore dispersal. To this end, we examined the ultrastructural features of the spores of seven closely related species in the moss genus Orthotrichum. These species all grow as epiphytes in sub-Mediterranean forests, and the group includes both xerochastic and hygrochastic members. First, we found that the spore wall layers exhibit several features previously undescribed in mosses. Second, we discovered that there are only subtle differences in spore ultrastructure with regards to spore wall thickness, the degree of plastid development, or the storage substances used. We suggest that the hygrochastic dispersal in mosses from Mediterranean environments might be related to a safe-site strategy, rather than to drought avoidance, and we underscore the necessity of conducting spore ultrastructural studies on a greater number of bryophyte species. 2014 Medina Est? banez.

The first version of the C-IAM is comprised of the extended Canadian Middle Atmosphere (CMAM) and the Murmansk's Upper Atmosphere Model (UAM), currently coupled in a one-way manner. The model extends from the surface to the inner magnetosphere and is able to describe the impact on the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of self-consistently generated lower atmosphere dynamical variability. In the current study, the C-IAM has been used to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for forming the 4-peak longitudinal structure of the 135.6. nm ionospheric emission observed by the IMAGE satellite over the tropics at 20:00 local time from March 20 to April 20, 2002. To perform this study, the C-IAM has been run for this whole observation period taking into account a realistic day-to-day variation in solar and geomagnetic activity. The 4-peak longitudinal structure produced by the model and averaged over the observation period is in a good agreement with the observations. Analysis of the model results suggests that the main mechanism for generating the longitudinal structure in the ionospheric emission after sunset is a modification of the ionospheric electric field in the E region caused in the course of the daytime by differences in the diurnal evolution of the zonal wind in different longitudinal sectors due to waves penetrating from the lower atmosphere. In agreement with the earlier findings, our study showed that this mechanism is driven mainly by the diurnal eastward propagating tide with zonal number 3. A small contribution to the formation of the 4-peak structure is also provided by longitudinal variations in meridional wind and neutral composition at the F2 layer altitudes. The 4 peaks being clearly visible in the monthly mean result are not, however, present every day. Day-to-day variability of both the diurnal wind evolution and geomagnetic activity can significantly modify the longitudinal structure of the ionospheric emission. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Atmosphere-ionosphere coupling; Ionospheric emission; Whole atmosphere modeling

After that the uncertainties of the COBRA calculations are discussed performing Monte-Carlo type statistical analyses taking into account the modeling uncertainties and other uncertainties prescribed in the OECD NEA UAM benchmark specification. Both steady-state and transient cases are investigated. The target quantities are the uncertainties of the void distribution, the moderator density, the moderator temperature and the DNBR.

In particular, the common benefit and mutual interact of the upstream and downstream enterprise in the supply chain is considered. Thus, a decentralized bi-level programming model is constructed. To deal with the fuzzy parameters in the objective functions, an expected value operation based on Me is employed. As to the feasible region with fuzzy coefficient, a similarity relation based on the fuzzy measure Pos is defined, based on which, the rough approximation method is adopted. Then, two rough approximation models (UAM and LAM) is developed.

The SCALE6.1 code package is used to propagate cross section covariance data through lattice physics calculations to both k-effective and two-group assembly-homogenized cross sections uncertainties.

In this study, nuclear data uncertainties have been propagated to LWR cores using accurate transport calculations. PWR benchmarks representative of the French NPP fleet were selected: one 900MWe (Fessenheim), one 1500MWe (CHOOZ), as two complementary GEN-III benchmarks belonging to the OECD/UAM benchmark, representative of large PWR UOX and partially loaded-MOX cores surrounded by thick stainless steel reflector. Reactivity and assembly power map sensitivity coefficients to multigroup cross sections have been calculated using perturbation theory tools implemented in ERANOS2/SNATCH transport code. Different sources of nuclear data uncertainty were compared: covariance matrices from BOLNA, and French COMAC associated to JEFF3.1.1 evaluations, were used for uncertainty propagation. The total uncertainty on the multiplication factor keff is not sensitive to the size and the loading of the PWR cores; this uncertainty amounts to 560pcm (1s) with COMAC, compared to 780 pcm with BOLNA covariances. The main component of keff uncertainty is U235, followed by 238U capture, sc U235 and sf U235. The uncertainty on the radial power map increases with the core size, due to higher Eigen Value Separation factor (EVS>20). For example, using COMAC covariances, the uncertainty in central assemblies increases from 1.5% for PWR-900MWe to 3.4% for large N4 and GEN-III PWRs. In the peripheral assemblies which can host the power peak, the uncertainty increases from 1.1% for 900MWe to 2% for large PWRs. Therefore, the potential power swing bias in JEFF3.1.1 core calculations varies from 2.6% for PWR-900MWe to 5-6% for N4 and large GEN-III PWRs. Using BOLNA covariance files, the uncertainty on the Pcentre/Pperiph power ratio amounts to 10% (5% with COMAC) for GEN-III PWR core, and up to 24% in the Gen-III MOX benchmark (12% with COMAC). Our powerful deterministic calculation scheme allowed the decomposition of the LWR parameter uncertainty in isotopic partial cross-section components. The main contributor to the power uncertainty is the 238U inelastic scattering: 3% and 5%, respectively for COMAC and BOLNA, in GEN-III central assemblies. However, 16O and 1H elastic scattering cross-sections should be also validated and improved in order to reduce their individual 1%-2% current contribution to the central power uncertainty. ?

Consequently OECD/NEA has initiated an international Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) benchmark focused on uncertainty analysis in best-estimate coupled code calculations for design, operation, and safety analysis of LWRs. The title of this benchmark is: ""Benchmarks for uncertainty analysis in modelling (UAM) for the design, operation and safety analysis of LWRs"", or often referred to as ""OECD/NEA UAM-LWR Benchmark"". Reference systems and scenarios for coupled code analysis are defined to study the uncertainty effects for all stages of the system calculations. Measured data from plant operation are available for the chosen scenarios. The general frame of the OECD/NEA UAM LWR benchmark consists of three phases with different exercises for each phase. This paper summarizes the benchmark activity and discusses the status of each phase and exercise. Selected results are shown to illustrate the technical approach in defining different exercises and findings from benchmark analysis. For the first time this benchmarks aims to determine the uncertainty in LWR system calculations at all stages of a coupled reactor physics/thermal-hydraulics/fuel performance calculation. The full chain of uncertainty propagation from basic data, engineering uncertainties, across different scales (multi-scale), and physics phenomena (multi-physics) are tested on a number of benchmark exercises for which experimental data are available and for which the power plant details have been released. As part of this effort, the development and assessment of different methods or techniques to account for the uncertainties in the calculations are investigated and reported, which contributes to the state-of-The-Art in this area. ?

The uncertainty analysis methodology is deterministic, meaning that the sensitivity profiles of the responses are com-puted first, after which uncertainty is propagated by combining the sensitivity profiles with the covariance matrices of the uncertain nuclear data. The sensitivity analysis is based on per-turbation theory which enables computing the sensitivity profiles efficiently by solving one generalized adjoint system for each response. The mathematical background of this work is reviewed and the main conclusions related to the implementation are summarized. Special emphasis is placed on the sensitivity analysis of two-group homogenized diffusion coefficients which require some modifications to the standard equations of generalized perturbation theory.

One of the nuclear data needs to this prediction is the independent fission yields. The mostly used general-purpose evaluated nuclear data libraries provide these data including their uncertainties as standard deviation, with no-correlation between fission yields. However, new developments in the theory and measurements of fission product yields are expected to result in new evaluated files in the next coming years. These files will include considerably more accurate yields including neutron energy dependence combined with new covariance information allowing realistic uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we focused on the effect of fission yield covariance information on criticality and depletion calculations. A LWR pin-cell burn-up benchmark, proposed in the general framework of the OECD/UAM Benchmark is analyzed to address the impact of independent fission yield uncertainties. Calculations were performed with the SCALE6 system and the ENDF/B-VII.1 fission yield data library, adding covariance data obtained from including covariance info of mass yields.

The lack of expert advice, on how to improve structural configuration utilizing local available materials and minimizing costs, left several damaged houses with highly inadequate retrofits. However, we could observe in damage recognition in recent earthquakes that the construction practice has improved, despite local and state seismic provisions; the affected population has learned the lessons of having houses with poor adobe blocks, or poor structural configurations. Seismic vulnerability studies conducted in El Salvador, in Central America, have also demonstrated that this seismic evolution is a current activity in countries with high seismic activity.

UAM objectives include among others, the quantification of uncertainties of neutronic calculations with respect to their value for the multi-physics analysis. Since the kinetics parameters and their uncertainties are of particular interest for these studies the deterministic approaches for analysis of uncertainties in nuclear reactor kinetic parameters (neutron generation lifetime and delayed neutron effective fraction) have been developed in frame of the UAM-LWR. The approach uses combination of generalization of perturbation theory to reactivity analysis, and the Generalized Perturbation Theory (GPT) for sensitivity computation. It has been applied to the UAM complementary fast neutron SNEAK test case that has unique set of experimental data for ¥âeff. In this example, the covariance matrices of nuclear data have been derived from COMMARA library by Bayesian adjustment upon the set of the fast neutron integral benchmarks with the BERING code package. Then, the kinetic parameters uncertainties with their correlations have been applied to simplified model of a reactivity insertion transient where relative uncertainty of power peak was taken as figure of merit. The results demonstrate that the uncertainties due to nuclear data impact significantly the energy release in a coupled transient modeling. It was also found that such uncertainties become higher if the correlations between uncertainties of different lumped parameters are taken into account. ? 2014 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.

As an example, we have investigated the sensitivity of the core radial power distribution to the nature of the reflector (conventional vs. a ¡°heavy¡± stainless-steel one), by applying a perturbation to some peripheral assemblies of an EPR-like reactor system (as defined in the UAM GEN-III benchmark, a fresh fuel core). The perturbation was selected to simulate possible assembly bowing effects, engendering a variation of the inter-assembly water gap, which can generate an azimuthal asymmetry in the power distribution. This is conventionally referred to as a 'power tilt'. The amplification effect of the reflector on the power tilt has been addressed in two steps. Firstly, we have compared the power tilt, computed with the deterministic code CRONOS2 (the neutronics diffusion module of the HEMERA chain) and with the probabilistic transport code MCNP, to validate the CRONOS2 response against a Monte-Carlo reference and obtain a quantification of the amplification effect at zero power. Then the feedbacks have been taken into account in the diffusion calculations to evaluate the sensitivity of the tilt to the power level. The explanation of the difference in the core behavior in the presence of either a conventional or a heavy reflector has been investigated through the examination of the power distributions and the eigenvalue splitting of the two systems. The results explain the higher sensitivity to a peripheral perturbation of a heavy-reflector-core compared to a conventionally-reflected one. ? 2014 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.

Although the TPM is designed to prevent software attacks, the TPM itself is vulnerable to physical attacks that could enable intruders to gain access to confidential data. In general, the TPM provides an ID and implements a password identification technique to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the TPM. The TPM user authentication is carried out by the TPM itself, which exposes the TPM to direct risk as highly skilled intruders can break the authentication line of defence and gain access to the TPM. The process of encrypting and decrypting information, especially when asymmetric algorithms are used, is viewed as a process that consumes time and resources, which decreases the speed of the computer. In order to solve the problems, a TPM User Authentication Model (TPM-UAM) that can provide the TPM with a higher level of security and resistance against physical attacks has been proposed as we proposed in our previous research paper (Alshar'e et al., 2014). The technique is based on biometric authentication to prove the identity of the users and to allow the process of authentication to happen at an independent platform using virtualization that will keep the TPM out of reach until a user is completely verified and approved. The TPM-UAM is able to provide a more satisfactory level of confidence for data and processes that can be rated as highly confidential and private. The model was successfully developed and tested and the results confirmed the model efficiency and ability to secure TPM and all functions have been confirmed to be working perfectly according to what they were designed for. This paper describes the design and implementation of TPM-UAM system based on the proposed authentication model, virtualization has been implemented to create authentication platform to prevent direct interaction with TPM and biometrics has been implemented to verify identities and supervise running TPM, the system testing results in confirming the system functionality and ability to secure and protect TPM. ? 2014 M.I.

It is observed that the mean value of the fuel maximum temperature slightly increases with burnup and that the standard deviation and its variation remain relatively small. In a second part, a global sensitivity analysis method based on Sobol indices is applied in an attempt to estimate the relative contributions of the various input parameters to the fuel temperature uncertainty.

A common strategy for performing lattice physics uncertainty analysis involves starting with nuclear data and covariance matrix which is typically available at infinite dilution. To describe the uncertainty of all multigroup physics parameters-including those at finite dilution - additional calculations must be performed that relate uncertainties in an infinite dilution cross-section to those at the problem dilution. Two potential methods for propagating dilution - related uncertainties were studied in this work. The first assumed a correlation between continuous-energy and multigroup cross-sectional data and uncertainties, which is convenient for direct implementation in lattice physics codes. The second is based on a more rigorous approach involving the Monte Carlo sampling of resonance parameters in evaluated nuclear data using the TALYS software. When applied to a light water fuel cell, the two approaches show significant differences, indicating that the assumption of the first method did not capture the complexity of physics parameter data uncertainties. It was found that the covariance of problem-dilution multigroup parameters for selected neutron cross-sections can vary significantly from their infinite-dilution counterparts. Copyright ? 2014 M. R.

Anaesthesia care in developed countries involves sophisticated technology and experienced providers. However, advanced machines may be inoperable or fail frequently when placed into the austere medical environment of a developing country. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a method for engaging local staff in identifying real or potential breakdowns in processes or work systems and to develop strategies to mitigate risks. Methods. Nurse anaesthetists from the two tertiary care hospitals in Freetown, Sierra Leone, participated in three sessions moderated by a human factors specialist and an anaesthesiologist. Sessions were audio recorded, and group discussion graphically mapped by the session facilitator for analysis and commentary. These sessions sought to identify potential barriers to implementing an anaesthesia machine designed for austere medical environments-the universal anaesthesia machine (UAM)-and also engaging local nurse anaesthetists in identifying potential solutions to these barriers. Results. Participating Sierra Leonean clinicians identified five main categories of failure modes (resource availability, environmental issues, staff knowledge and attitudes, and workload and staffing issues) and four categories of mitigation strategies (resource management plans, engaging and educating stakeholders, peer support for new machine use, and collectively advocating for needed resources). Conclusions. We identified factors that may limit the impact of a UAM and devised likely effective strategies for mitigating those risks. ?

This study was focused on the nominal localized stand-alone fuel thermal response, as defined in Ex. 1-3 and 1-4 of the HTR UAM. The aim of the stand-alone thermal unit-cell simulation is to isolate the effect of material and boundary input uncertainties on a very simplified problem, before propagation of these uncertainties are performed in subsequent coupled neutronics/thermal fluids phases on the benchmark. In many of the previous studies for high temperature gas cooled reactors, the volume-averaged homogeneous mixture model of a single fuel compact has been applied. In the homogeneous model, the Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles in the fuel compact were not modeled directly and an effective thermal conductivity was employed for the thermo-physical properties of the fuel compact. On the contrary, in the heterogeneous model, the uranium carbide (UCO), inner and outer pyrolytic carbon (IPyC/OPyC) and silicon carbide (SiC) layers of the TRISO fuel particles are explicitly modeled. The fuel compact is modeled as a heterogeneous mixture of TRISO fuel kernels embedded in H-451 matrix graphite. In this study, a steady-state and transient CFD simulations were performed with both homogeneous and heterogeneous models to compare the thermal characteristics. The nominal values of the input parameters are used for this CFD analysis. In a future study, the effects of input uncertainties in the material properties and boundary parameters will be investigated and reported.",

The benchmark has been named the OECD/NEA UAM-LWR benchmark, and has been divided into three phases each of which focuses on a different portion of the uncertainty propagation in LWR multi-physics and multi-scale analysis. Several different reactor cases are modeled at various phases of a reactor calculation. This paper discusses Phase I, known as the ""Neutronics Phase"", which is devoted mostly to the propagation of nuclear data (cross-section) uncertainty throughout steady-state stand-alone neutronics core calculations. Three reactor systems (for which design, operation and measured data are available) are rigorously studied in this benchmark: Peach Bottom Unit 2 BWR, Three Mile Island Unit 1 PWR, and VVER-1000 Kozloduy-6/Kalinin-3. Additional measured data is analyzed such as the KRITZ LEU criticality experiments and the SNEAK-7A and 7B experiments of the Karlsruhe Fast Critical Facility. Analyzed results include the top five neutronnuclide reactions, which contribute the most to the prediction uncertainty in keff, as well as the uncertainty in key parameters of neutronics analysis such as microscopic and macroscopic cross-sections, six-group decay constants, assembly discontinuity factors, and axial and radial core power distributions. Conclusions are drawn regarding where further studies should be done to reduce uncertainties in key nuclide reaction uncertainties (i.e.: 238U radiative capture and inelastic scattering (n, n') as well as the average number of neutrons released per fission event of 239Pu).",Correlation; Covariance; Sensitivity; UAM; Uncertainty; Variance

To dissect the genetic relationships between PH and individual PHC, both unconditional (UAM) and conditional association mapping (CAM) were conducted by phenotyping 278 japonica rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica) accessions with 154 polymorphic SSR markers in 2010 and 2011. A total of 26 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) (P < 0.001) for PH were identified by using UAM within 19 markers in both years. Seven of the 19 markers were associated with PH in both 2010 and 2011. By using CAM, additional 35 significant MTAs (P < 0.001) were identified within 27 markers in 2 yr, when the influences of SL, FIL, SIL, TIL and FOIL were excluded. Four of the 27 markers were suppressed by different components in both years. CAM indicated that TIL contributed the most to PH, followed by SL, FOIL, SIL, and FIL. Any associated marker for PH identified by UAM and CAM was associated with at least one of the five PHC traits and explained 2.76 ~ 15.20% of the phenotypic variation. The CAM could be used to evaluate genetic relationships between PH and PHC, and efficiently and precisely reveal counteracting associated markers.

The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has introduced the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as a solution to end-users to ensure their privacy and confidentiality. TPM has the role of being the root of trust for systems and users by providing protected storage that is accessible only within TPM and thus, protects computers against unwanted access. TPM is designed to prevent software attacks with minimal consideration being given toward physical attacks. Therefore, TPM focus on PIN password identification to control the physical presence of a user. The PIN Password method is not the ideal user verification method. Evil Maid is one of the attacking methods where a piece of code can be loaded and hidden in the boot loader before loading TPM. The code will then collects confidential information at the next boot and store it or send it to attackers via the network. In order to solve this problem, a number of solutions have been proposed. However, most of these solutions does not provide sufficient level of protection to TPM. In this study we introduce the TPM User Authentication Model (TPM-UAM) that could assist in protecting TPM against physical attack and thus increase the security of the computer system. The proposed model has been evaluated through a focus group discussion consisting of a number of experts. The expert panel has confirmed that the proposed model is sufficient to provide expected level of protection to the TPM and to assist in preventing physical attack against TPM. ? 2014 Science Publications.",Authentication; Biometrics; Privacy; Security; TPM; Virtualization; Xen

The contribution of nuclear data uncertainty on the power distribution of a UOX and a MOX core is assessed with the XSUSA tool. Overall, the results obtained with different tools in both institutions are in good agreement, showing that the power distribution uncertainty due to the use of different simulation tools is much lower than the one due to nuclear data, which is a large contributor.

We also quantify the contribution from cross-material correlations to the uncertainties. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Cross-material covariances; ENDF/B-VII.1; JEFF-3.2; JENDL-4.0u; Prediction capability; Uncertainty analysis

Here, we address this problem by developing a new meanfield substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that themost variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The meanfield models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitutionmodel assigns larger likelihood than the empiricalmodel to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence.

We also evaluated the correlation between mast cell tryptase and CD31 expression to clarify the role of mast cells (MCs) in the growth of odontogenic tumors. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-MC tryptase and anti-CD31 antibodies was performed on 48 cases of odontogenic tumors including solid ameloblastoma (SAM), unicystic ameloblastoma (UAM), odontogenic myxoma (OM), cystic calcifying odontogenic tumor (CCOT) and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT). Ten high power fields were analyzed for each sample. Total MC count was significantly increased in SAM compared to other odontogenic tumors (p < 0.05). Microvessel density was statistically higher in SAM and AOT compared to remaining odontogenic tumors (p < 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between MCs and microvessels in odontogenic tumors (p = 0.018, r = 0.34). Our findings suggest a role for MCs in aggressive clinical behavior of odontogenic tumors. The significant correlation found between MC count and microvessel density in odontogenic tumors is in agreement with the theory of participation of MCs in tumor progression. Targeting MC activity may represent an important nonsurgical therapeutic approach, especially for aggressive odontogenic tumors. ? 2015, Versalius University Medical Publisher.

The classical ERP-based speller, or P300 Speller, is one of the most commonly used paradigms in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Several alterations to the visual stimuli presentation system have been developed to avoid unfavorable effects elicited by adjacent stimuli. However, there has been little, if any, regard to useful information contained in responses to adjacent stimuli about spatial location of target symbols. This paper aims to demonstrate that combining the classification of non-target adjacent stimuli with standard classification (target versus non-target) significantly improves classical ERP-based speller efficiency. Approach. Four SWLDA classifiers were trained and combined with the standard classifier: the lower row, upper row, right column and left column classifiers. This new feature extraction procedure and the classification method were carried out on three open databases: the UAM P300 database (Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico), BCI competition II (dataset IIb) and BCI competition III (dataset II). Main results. The inclusion of the classification of non-target adjacent stimuli improves target classification in the classical row/column paradigm. A gain in mean single trial classification of 9.6% and an overall improvement of 25% in simulated spelling speed was achieved. Significance. We have provided further evidence that the ERPs produced by adjacent stimuli present discriminable features, which could provide additional information about the spatial location of intended symbols. This work promotes the searching of information on the peripheral stimulation responses to improve the performance of emerging visual ERP-based spellers. ? 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",adjacent stimuli; ERP-based BCI; P300 Speller

Several different approaches have been suggested to combine the responses of DMs into a compromise or consensus ranking from a diverse perspective. These methods either fuse basic rankings in a simple average way or suffer from high complexity to prevent themselves from conducting large-scale rankings. In light of this, we propose a new model for consensus ranking with a union adjacency matrix (UAM), which summarizes the ranking information of each pair in basic rankings. By this means, we transfer the consensus ranking problem (CRP) into a graph ranking problem (GRP) and take PageRank algorithm to achieve the consensus solution. Compared with traditional methods, it can deal with the expert weight, sequence absence and difference quantization problems. As demonstrated in the experiment, our model not only has high efficiency and good effectiveness, but also enjoys good stability and scalability.

However, to date what has not been examined is the change in aggregate morphology during milling itself, i.e. it is not clear if wet milling simply fragments aggregates into smaller, similarly structured entities, or if milling can simultaneously lead to aggregate restructuring. Here we develop and apply methods to examine the change in morphology in titania and alumina nanoparticle aggregates (primary particle radii of ~. 8.25. nm and 7.20. nm, respectively) during wet milling with a Kotobuki Industries UAM-015 wet mill. Specifically, via nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with a Nanosight LM-14 and simultaneous viscosity measurements, we characterized the hydrodynamic radius distribution functions and average intrinsic viscosities of both titania and alumina aggregates milled at 1% volume fraction in water. With NTA we found that for both particle types, milling led to a reduction in hydrodynamic radii. Conversely, the average intrinsic viscosity of titania decreased, while it increased for alumina with increasing milling time. By assuming aggregates were quasifractal in morphology (and hence characterized by the number of primary per particles per aggregate, the pre-exponential factor, and the fractal dimension) and by using Monte Carlo based techniques to link quasifractal aggregate descriptors to both the hydrodynamic radius and the intrinsic viscosity for an aggregate, measured hydrodynamic radius distribution functions and average intrinsic viscosities were used to infer titania and alumina aggregate quasifractal descriptors as functions of milling time. Through this analysis we found that both particle types were initially dense aggregates (fractal dimensions >. 2.9), and for titania milling did not alter aggregate morphology (i.e. titania aggregates remained dense). However, alumina aggregates were found to decrease in fractal dimension with increasing milling time, reaching a value near 1.6 after 180. minutes of milling. Such chain-like structures give rise to an increase in suspension viscosity despite the fact that alumina aggregate size decreased with milling. Overall, we show that depending on the particle material (and surfactant employed), milling may simultaneously lead to aggregate size reduction and restructuring, and may be a viable approach to the production of controlled morphology aggregates. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Aggregates; Bead milling; Communition; Nanoparticles; Quasifractals

As a result of the wide use of electronic records management systems (ERMS) in agencies, the focus is on several issues relating to the interaction of the agency¡¯s ERMS and public repositories. This paper indicates the importance of using digital recordkeeping metadata to meet more precisely and at the same time semi-automatically the criteria set by memory institutions. The paper provides an overview of one prospective solution and describes the Estonian National Archives¡¯ universal archiving module (UAM). A case study reports the use of the UAM in preserving the digital records of the Estonian Minister for Population and Ethnic Affairs. In this project, the preparation and transfer of archival records was divided into ten phases, starting from the description of the archival creator and ending with controlled transfer. The case study raises questions about how much recordkeeping metadata can be used in archival description and how the interaction of the agency¡¯s ERMS and ingest by the archives could be more automated. The main issues (e.g. classification, metadata elements variations, mapping, and computer files conversions) encountered during that project are discussed. Findings show that the Open Archival Information System functional model¡¯s ingest part should be reconceptualised to take into account preparatory work. Adding detailed metadata about the structure, context and relationships in the right place at the right time could get one step closer to digital codified knowledge archiving by creating synergies with various other digital repositories. ? 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Digital preservation; Estonia; Ingest; Pre-ingest; Universal archiving module

In this study the classical method (CM) and unit area methods (UAM) in the estimation of DRF in unilateral hydronephrosis before and after intervention were compared. Methods: Twenty patients (12 M, 8 F; mean: 42.6¡¾18.5 years old) who were candidates for surgery or intervention because of unilateral hydronephrosis were the subjects of this study. All the patients were evaluated by Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy before and 3-6 months after the intervention. In order to estimate DRF both CM and UAM (obtained by division of the counts including the kidney ROI to pixel of the same ROI) were performed. Bland-Altman analyses were performed in order to compare the DRF values obtained from both methods. Results: The agreement between CM and UAM was poor in the preoperative estimation, however, the agreement was good after the operation or intervention. Conclusions: In this study it seems that DRF estimation with CM in unilateral hydronephrosis might be problematic in the determination of surgery thus UAM might be introduced as the method of choice in the determination of DRF in unilateral hyronephrosis. ? 2014, Zehra Pinar Ko? et al.",Differential renal function; DMSA; hydronephrosis; unit area

It is found predominantly in the furanose form rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. UDPL-Arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf ), rather than UDP-L-Arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap), is a sugar donor for the biosynthesis of arabinofuranosyl (Araf ) residues. UDP-Arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs) have been shown to interconvert UDPAraf and UDP-Arap and are involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides including Araf. The UAM gene family has three members in Oryza sativa. Co-expression network in silico analysis showed that OsUAM3 expression was independent from OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 co-expression networks. OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 were expressed ubiquitously throughout plant development, but OsUAM3 was expressed primarily in reproductive tissue, particularly at the pollen cell wall formation developmental stage. OsUAM3 coexpression networks include pectin catabolic enzymes. To determine the function of OsUAMs in reproductive tissues, we analyzed RNA interference (RNAi)-knockdown transformants (OsUAM3-KD) specific for OsUAM3. OsUAM3-KD plants grew normally and showed abnormal phenotypes in reproductive tissues, especially in terms of the pollen cell wall and exine. In addition, we examined modifications of cell wall polysaccharides at the cellular level using antibodies against polysaccharides including Araf. Immunolocalization of arabinan using the LM6 antibody showed low levels of arabinan in OsUAM3-KD pollen grains. Our results suggest that the function of OsUAM3 is important for synthesis of arabinan side chains of RG-I and is required for reproductive developmental processes, especially the formation of the cell wall in pollen. ?

In spite of the evidence supporting GAA toxicity and its role in CYN synthesis, no data have been reported on the accumulation of GAA in any cyanobacterium.

Through the combined application of genre theory and a typology of CLIL teacher academic questions, the study aims at contributing to the understanding of how CLIL students use the foreign language to express academic meanings. The data are part of the UAM-CLIL project, which focuses on the systemic-functional analysis of CLIL students¡¯ language production. In this paper, we analyze class discussions on various topics in two secondary schools. These discussions were carried out at the end of a topic and followed a prompt that aimed at triggering participation in different history genres: recount, account, explanation and argument. The aim of the study is twofold: first, the academic questions used by the teachers are classified in relation to the genre triggered by the prompt; second, we analyze the length and complexity of the students¡¯ responses. The results show that the teachers did not always ask the questions related to the prompt. In fact, they frequently used questions for facts, which usually triggered shorter and less complex responses than other types. ? 2014, ? 2014 Taylor & Francis.",academic questions; classroom interaction; CLIL; genre; systemic-functional linguistics

Most methods fall into the two broad classes of Monte Carlo approaches, which are exact apart from statistical uncertainties but require additional computation time, and first order perturbation theory approaches, which are efficient for not too large numbers of considered response functions but only applicable for sufficiently small nuclear data uncertainties. Some methods neglect isotopic composition uncertainties induced by the depletion steps of the simulations, others neglect neutron flux uncertainties, and the accuracy of a given approximation is often very hard to quantify. In order to get a better sense of the impact of different approximations, this work aims to compare results obtained based on different approximate methodologies with an exact method, namely the NUDUNA Monte Carlo based approach developed by AREVA GmbH. In addition, the impact of different covariance data is studied by comparing two of the presently most complete nuclear data covariance libraries (ENDF/B-VII.1 and SCALE 6.0), which reveals a high dependency of the uncertainty estimates on the source of covariance data. The burn-up benchmark Exercise I-1b proposed by the OECD expert group ""Benchmarks for Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) for the Design, Operation and Safety Analysis of LWRs"" is studied as an example application. The burn-up simulations are performed with the SCALE 6.0 tool suite. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing SS-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of propagating uncertainties in multigroup nuclear data. However, in fields such as criticality safety assessment, pointwise representation of nuclear data is more appropriate in order to corroborate the increasing safety demand and best-estimate modeling capabilities. In this work, an SS-based tool, called NUSS is implemented which perturbs pointwise ACE-formatted nuclear data using multigroup nuclear data covariance. The use of pointwise ACE-formatted nuclear data in NUSS can accommodate flexible multigroup covariance structures and allows for nuclear data uncertainty propagation through the continuous/pointwise-energy transport code MCNPX. As a first step of the NUSS development and verification, uncertainty contributions from 239Pu and 235U nuclear data were assessed for Jezebel (Pu-fueled) and Godiva (U-fueled) fast-spectrum criticality benchmarks. NUSS results are compared to those by other uncertainty quantification methods such as TSUNAMI and MCNPX PERT CARD.

For this reason in the UAM-Xochimilco the use of puzzolanic substances in combination with lime it is testing in order to reduce the time for soil stabilization as well as improving its resistance, avoiding cement's collateral problems.

In Europe Aphanizomenon gracile and Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi are the only known producers of PSP toxins and are found in Southwest and Central European freshwater bodies. In this study the PSP toxin producing Aphanizomenon sp. strain NIVA-CYA 851 was isolated from the Norwegian Lake Hillestadvannet. In a polyphasic approach NIVA-CYA 851 was morphologically and phylogenetically classified, and investigated for toxin production. The strain NIVA-CYA 851 was identified as A. gracile using 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and was confirmed to produce neosaxitoxin, saxitoxin and gonyautoxin 5 by LC-MS. The whole sxt gene clusters (circa 27.3 kb) of four A. gracile strains: NIVA-CYA 851 (Norway); NIVA-CYA 655 & NIVA-CYA 676 (Germany); and UAM 529 (Spain), all from latitudes between 40¡Æ and 59¡Æ North were sequenced and compared with the sxt gene cluster of reference strain A. gracile NH-5 from the USA. All five sxt gene clusters are highly conserved with similarities exceeding 99.4%, but they differ slightly in the number and presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (In/Dels). Altogether 178 variable sites (44 SNPs and 4 In/Dels, comprising 134 nucleotides) were found in the sxt gene clusters of the Norwegian, German and Spanish strains compared to the reference strain. Thirty-nine SNPs were located in 16 of the 27 coding regions. The sxt gene clusters of NIVA-CYA 851, NIVACYA 655, NIVA-CYA 676 and UAM 529, were characterized by 15, 16, 19 and 23 SNPs respectively. Only the Norwegian strain NIVA-CYA 851 possessed an insertion of 126 base pairs (bp) in the noncoding area between the sxtA and sxtE genes and a deletion of 6 nucleotides in the sxtN gene. The sxtI gene showed the highest variability and is recommended as the best genetic marker for further phylogenetic studies of the sxt gene cluster of A. gracile. This study confirms for the first time the role of A. gracile as a PSP toxin producer in Norwegian waters, representing the northernmost occurrence of PSP toxin producing A. gracile in Europe known so far.

Our starting point is to show that?in contrast to plain randomized communication complexity?every boolean function admits an AM communication protocol where on each yes-input, the distribution of Merlin¡¯s proof leaks no information about the input and moreover, this proof is unique for each outcome of Arthur¡¯s randomness. We posit that these two properties of zero information leakage and unambiguity on yes-inputs are interesting in their own right and worthy of investigation as new avenues toward AM. Zero-information protocols (ZAM): Our basic ZAM protocol uses exponential communication for some functions, and this raises the question of whether more efficient protocols exist. We prove that all functions in the classical space-bounded complexity classes NL and ? L have polynomial-communication ZAM protocols. We also prove that ZAM complexity is lower bounded by conondeterministic communication complexity. Unambiguous protocols (UAM): Our most technically substantial result is a ¥Ø (n) lower bound on the UAM complexity of the NP-complete set-intersection function; the proof uses information complexity arguments in a new, indirect way and overcomes the ¡°zero-information barrier¡± described above. We also prove that in general, UAM complexity is lower bounded by the classic discrepancy bound, and we give evidence that it is not generally lower bounded by the classic corruption bound. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Arthur?Merlin communication; Unambiguity; Zero-information protocols

Saccharification and biofuel yields are inhibited by the plant cell wall¡¯s natural recalcitrance against enzymatic degradation. Plant hemicellulose polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans structurally support and cross-link other cell wall polymers. Grasses predominately have Type II cell walls that are abundant in arabinoxylan, which comprise nearly 25% of aboveground biomass. A primary component of arabinoxylan synthesis is uridine diphosphate (UDP) linked to arabinofuranose (Araf). A family of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM)/reversible glycosylated polypeptides catalyze the interconversion between UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-Araf. Results: The expression of a switchgrass arabinoxylan biosynthesis pathway gene, PvUAM1, was decreased via RNAi to investigate its role in cell wall recalcitrance in the feedstock. PvUAM1 encodes a switchgrass homolog of UDP-arabinose mutase, which converts UDP-Arap to UDP-Araf. Southern blot analysis revealed each transgenic line contained between one to at least seven T-DNA insertions, resulting in some cases, a 95% reduction of native PvUAM1 transcript in stem internodes. Transgenic plants had increased pigmentation in vascular tissues at nodes, but were otherwise similar in morphology to the non-transgenic control. Cell wall-associated arabinose was decreased in leaves and stems by over 50%, but there was an increase in cellulose. In addition, there was a commensurate change in arabinose side chain extension. Cell wall lignin composition was altered with a concurrent increase in lignin content and transcript abundance of lignin biosynthetic genes in mature tillers. Enzymatic saccharification efficiency was unchanged in the transgenic plants relative to the control. Conclusion: Plants with attenuated PvUAM1 transcript had increased cellulose and lignin in cell walls. A decrease in cell wall-associated arabinose was expected, which was likely caused by fewer Araf residues in the arabinoxylan. The decrease in arabinoxylan may cause a compensation response to maintain cell wall integrity by increasing cellulose and lignin biosynthesis. In cases in which increased lignin is desired, e.g., feedstocks for carbon fiber production, downregulated UAM1 coupled with altered expression of other arabinoxylan biosynthesis genes might result in even higher production of lignin in biomass. ? 2016 Willis, Smith, Mazarei, Zhang, Turner, Decker, Sykes, Poovaiah, Baxter, Mann, Davis, Udvardi, Pe?a, Backe, Bar-Peled and Stewart.",Biofuel; Hemicellulose arabinoxylan; Recalcitrance; Switchgrass; UDP-arabinopyranose mutase/reversible glycosylated polypeptide

The use of a more fundamental methodology is also consistent with the reliable high fidelity physics models and robust, efficient, and accurate codes available today. To facilitate uncertainty analysis applications a comprehensive approach and methodology must be developed and applied, in contrast to the historical approach where sensitivity analysis were performed and uncertainties then determined by a simplified statistical combination of a few important input parameters. New methodologies are currently under development in the OECD/NEA Light Water Reactor (LWR) Uncertainty Analysis in Best-Estimate Modelling (UAM) benchmark activity. High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) designs require specific treatment of the double heterogeneous fuel design and large graphite quantities at high temperatures. The IAEA has therefore launched a Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on HTGR Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling (UAM) in 2013 to study uncertainty propagation specifically in the HTGR analysis chain. Two benchmark problems are defined, with the prismatic design represented by the General Atomics (GA) MHTGR-350 and a 250?MW modular pebble bed design similar to the Chinese HTR-PM. Work has started on the first phase and the current CRP status is reported in the paper. A comparison of the Serpent and SCALE/KENO-VI reference Monte Carlo results for Ex.

The use of the latest ENDF-B-VII.1 cross section library in Serpent lead to ¡­180?pcm lower k¡Ä values compared to the older ENDF-B-VII.0 dataset, caused by the modified graphite neutron capture cross section. The fourth beta release of SCALE 6.2 likewise produced lower CE k¡Ä values when compared to SCALE 6.1, and the improved performance of the new 252-group library available in SCALE 6.2 is especially noteworthy.

The Seniors-ENRICA cohort (n = 1911) was recruited in 2008/2010 and followed-up through 2012. At baseline, a diet history was used to obtain food consumption. Mediterranean diet adherence was measured with the PREDIMED score and the Trichopoulou's Mediterranean Diet Score (MSD). HRQL was assessed, at baseline and at the end of follow-up, with the physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS) of the SF-36 questionnaire in the UAM-cohort, and the SF-12v.2 questionnaire in the Seniors-ENRICA cohort. Analyses were conducted with linear regression, and adjusted for the main confounders including baseline HRQL. Results: In the UAM-cohort, no significant associations between the UAM-MDP and the PCS or the MCS were found. In the Seniors-ENRICA cohort, a higher PREDIMED score was associated with a slightly better PCS; when compared with the lowest tertile of PREDIMED score, the beta coefficient (95% confidence interval) for PCS was 0.55 (-0.48 to 1.59) in the second tertile, and 1.34 (0.21 to 2.47) in the highest tertile. However, the PREDIMED score was non-significantly associated with a better MCS score. The MSD did not show an association with either the PCS or the MCS. Conclusions: No clinically relevant association was found between the Mediterranean diet and HRQL in older adults in Spain. ? 2016 P?rez-Tasigchana et al.

However, the engineered tissue transparency is low due to the translucent thick underlying AM stroma. To overcome this drawback, we developed an ultra-thin AM (UAM) by using collagenase IV to strip away from the epithelial denuded AM (DAM) some of the stroma. By thinning the stroma to about 30 ? 1/4m, its moist and dry forms were rendered acellular, optically clear and its collagen framework became compacted and inerratic. Engineered rabbit corneal epithelial cell (RCEC) sheets generated through expansion of limbal epithelial cells on UAM were more transparent and thicker than those expanded on DAM. Moreover, ? ""Np63 and ABCG2 gene expression was greater in tissue engineered cell sheets expanded on UAM than on DAM. Furthermore, 2 weeks after surgery, the cornea grafted with UAM based cell sheets showed higher transparency and more stratified epithelium than the cornea grafted with DAM based cell sheets. Taken together, tissue engineered corneal epithelium generated on UAM has a preferable outcome because the transplanted tissue is more transparent and better resembles the phenotype of the native tissue than that obtained by using DAM for this procedure. UAM preserves compact layer of the amniotic membrane and maybe an ideal substrate for corneal epithelial tissue engineering.",

When the genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, the corresponding HvUAM1, HvUAM2, and HvUAM3 proteins exhibit UAM activity, and the kinetic properties of the enzymes have been determined, including Km, Kcat, and catalytic efficiencies. However, the expressed HvUAM4 protein shows no mutase activity against UDP-Ara or against a broad range of other nucleotide sugars and related molecules. The enzymic data indicate therefore that the HvUAM4 protein may not be a mutase. However, the HvUAM4 gene is transcribed at high levels in all the barley tissues examined, and its transcript abundance is correlated with transcript levels for other genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. The UDP-l-Arap ¡æ UDP-l-Araf reaction, which is essential for the generation of the UDP-Araf substrate for arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan protein, and pectic polysaccharide biosynthesis, is thermodynamically unfavorable and has an equilibrium constant of 0.02.

As an example, we have investigated the sensitivity of the radial power distribution in the core to the nature of the reflector (conventional vs. a ¡°heavy¡± stainless-steel one). This was done by applying a perturbation to some peripheral assemblies of the UAM GEN-III benchmark with a fresh fuel core. The perturbation was selected to simulate possible assembly bowing effects, causing a variation of the inter-assembly water gap, which can generate an azimuthal asymmetry in the power distribution. This is conventionally referred to as a ¡®power tilt¡¯. The amplification effect of the reflector on the power tilt for fresh fuel has been addressed in two steps. Firstly, we have compared the power tilt, computed with the deterministic code CRONOS2 (the neutronics diffusion module of the HEMERA chain) to that found with the probabilistic transport code MCNP, so as to validate the CRONOS2 response against a Monte Carlo reference and also obtain a quantification of the amplification effect at zero power. Then the thermal feedback and burn-up effects have been accounted for in the diffusion calculations so as to evaluate the sensitivity of the power tilt to the reactor operating conditions. The difference in the behavior of the cores with a conventional and a heavy reflector has been investigated through the examination of the power distributions and the dominance ratio of the systems, as well as of the assembly-wise infinite multiplication factors. Whilst the results help to explain the higher sensitivity to a peripheral perturbation of a fresh fuel heavy-reflected core compared to a conventionally-reflected one, they do not enable fully comprehensive conclusions to be drawn, especially towards End Of Cycle, due to the model assumptions and the limitation in the eigenvalue expansion. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Eigenvalue splitting; GEN-III core; Power tilt; Sensitivity

It is important to methodically propagate uncertainty through the modeling process to learn the downstream physics better as well as provide margins for the designers. Currently, methods based on sampling and perturbation theory are widely used in this area. The research here demonstrates the methods developed with the SCALE and PARCS code systems and its application to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) benchmark exercise 1-3. The uncertainty from nuclear input is sampled by SCALE/Sampler to generate perturbed libraries, and the perturbed library files are used for SCALE/POLARIS to perform lattice analysis and prepare cross section files for PARCS. Statistical analysis is then performed on PARCS results to determine the mean and standard deviation values on the core design parameters such as keff and power peaking factor. Using this methodology, the uncertainty from nuclear data input is propagated through the core design process, in this work, the reactor studied is the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor. The uncertainty of the keff for this reactor was found to be about 500 pcm. For power distributions, it was found that this reactor had an axial power distribution that was not very sensitive to the nuclear input uncertainties and a radial power distribution with higher uncertainties on the inner region of the core.",PARCS; POLARIS; Sampler; SCALE; Uncertainty

It is expected that for the HTGR UAM benchmark, some of the unique features of HTGRs (the coated particle fuel, higher operating temperature, and large mass of graphite) will result in some unique aspects to be identified in the uncertainty calculations. This paper represents the uncertainty result in the multiplication factor due to the covariance matrices for Exercise 1-1 (cell calculation) of Phase I (local neutronics) of the prismatic HTGR design. It contains four sub cases with two hexagonal and two triangular unit cell models defined to be at two operating conditions (293K and 1200K).

An ¡°unaccompanied minor¡± (UAM) is a third-country national or a stateless person under eighteen years of age, who arrives on the territory of the Member State unaccompanied by an adult responsible for him/her whether by law or by the practice of the Member State concerned, and for as long as he or she is not effectively taken into the care of such a person; it includes a minor who is left unaccompanied after he/she entered the territory of the Member States. As many as 95.985 UAMs applied for international protection in an EU member country just in 2015, almost four times the number registered in the previous year. The UAMs arrived in Italy were 28.283 in 2016; 94% of them were males, 92% unaccompanied, 8% of them under 15; the 53,6% is 17; the individuals between 16 and 17 are instead the 82%. Many of them (50%), 6561 in 2016, escaped from the sanctuaries, thus avoiding to be formally identified and registered in Italy in the attempt to reach more easily northern Europe countries, since The Dublin Regulations (2003) state that the asylum application should be held in the EU country of entrance or where parents reside. The age assessment procedures can therefore be considered as a relevant task that weighs in on the shoulders of the forensic experts with all the related issues and the coming of age is the important threshold. In the EU laws on asylum, the minors are considered as one of the groups of vulnerable persons towards whom Member States have specific obligations. A proper EU common formal regulation in the matter of age estimation procedures still lacks.

Here, the effect of these amino acids on the production of CYN in cultures of the cylindrospermopsin-producing strain, Aphanizomenon ovalisporum UAM-MAO, has been studied. Arg clearly increased CYN content, the increment appearing triphasic along the culture. On the contrary, Gly caused a decrease of CYN, observable from the first day on. Interestingly, the transcript of the gene ntcA, key in nitrogen metabolism control, was also enhanced in the presence of Arg and/or Gly, the trend of the transcript oscillations being like that of aoa/cyr. The inhibitory effect of Gly in CYN production seems not to result from diminishing the activity of genes considered involved in CYN synthesis, since Gly, as Arg, enhance the transcription of genes aoaA-C and cyrJ. On the other hand, culture growth is affected by Arg and Gly in a similar way to CYN production, with Arg stimulating and Gly impairing it. Taken together, our data show that the influence of both Arg and Gly on CYN changes seems not to be due to a specific effect on the first step of CYN synthesis; it rather appears to be the result of changes in the physiological cell status. ? 2017 by the authors.

As it has a great impact on the financial performance for retail stores, retailers take it as the crucial activity and the nucleus for an intelligent inventory control system. In this paper, we consider the assortment planning with substitution (a substitute product when the original choice is unavailable) under a fuzzy environment and then a fuzzy optimization model is built to obtain maximum benefits for retailers. For the fuzzy variables in the objective functions, we propose a fuzzy measure which can represent any attitudes between extremely optimistic and pessimistic to handle objective functions and get their expected value. For the constraints, a similarity relationship based on the fuzzy measure is defined, and the feasible region is addressed by the rough approximation based on this similarity relationship. Then, the lower approximation model (LAM) and the upper approximation model (UAM), which can avoid losing much information in the modeling process, are generated. To solve the model, a hybrid genetic algorithm with rough simulation is proposed. Finally, an application is used to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the model and solution algorithm. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Assortment planning; Fuzzy environment; Multi-objective programming model; Rough approximation

Analyses are done for a Light Water Reactor (LWR) pin cell based on Phase I of the UAM LWR benchmark. The negligence of implicit effects in XSUSA and TSUNAMI leads to deviations of a few percent between the sensitivity profiles compared to SAMPLER and TSUNAMI (incl. implicit effects) except for 238U elastic scattering. The implicit effect is much larger for the SHARK-X calculations because of its coarser energy group structure between 10 eV and 10 keV compared to the applied SCALE libraries. It is concluded that the influence of the implicit effect strongly depends on the energy mesh of the nuclear data library of the neutron transport solver involved in the UQ calculations and may be magnified by the response considered. ?

However, regulatory bodies worldwide are trending toward requiring such analyses for reactor fuel cycle calculations, which also requires uncertainty propagation for isotopics and nuclear reaction rates. XSUSA is a proven methodology for cross section uncertainty propagation based on random sampling of the nuclear data according to covariance data in multi-group representation; HELIOS2 is a lattice code widely used for commercial and research reactor fuel cycle calculations. This work describes a technique to automatically propagate the nuclear data uncertainties via the XSUSA approach through fuel lattice calculations in HELIOS2. Application of the XSUSA methodology in HELIOS2 presented some unusual challenges because of the highly-processed multi-group cross section data used in commercial lattice codes. Currently, uncertainties based on the SCALE 6.1 covariance data file are being used, but the implementation can be adapted to other covariance data in multi-group structure. Pin-cell and assembly depletion calculations, based on models described in the UAM-LWR Phase I and II benchmarks, are performed and uncertainties in multiplication factor, reaction rates, isotope concentrations, and delayed-neutron data are calculated. With this extension, it will be possible for HELIOS2 users to propagate nuclear data uncertainties directly from the microscopic cross sections to subsequent core simulations. ?

Our objective is to propose SP indicators of healthy brains (control groups) based on the default mode and their modifications by habituation and visual-motor association (VM-asso), to support diagnostic and rehabilitation processes. However, important differences seem to exist between men and women. Therefore, we aim to analyze EEG characteristics in a female sample. Subjects and Methods: In the current study, EEG was recorded at rest with closed eyes before and during repeated photostimulations (RPh) and before (pre) and during association of RPh with switch pressing (VM-asso) in 70 female adults. EEG was analyzed using UAM/INR software, which removes artifacts, identifies corresponding signals, selects 20 samples (2-s) from each condition, applies Welch's periodogram to calculate and average the absolute power (AP; AAPs) of ¥ä, ¥è, ¥á, and ¥â, before and during learning, and emits data to a spreadsheet. Differences in each condition were evaluated using non-parametric tests. Results: The AAPs were different; in habituation, ¥ä and ¥è increased significantly in fronto-frontal (FF) and frontocentral and decreased in the other leads. During association, they increased in FF and decreased in the other three regions, ¥á AAP decreased in all leads except in FF during habituation, and the decrement was lower in the association, ¥â AAP increased in all leads during both learning conditions.

SIMULATE-3 code sequence in the context of the OECD/NEA benchmark ¡®Uncertainty Analysis in Best-Estimate Modelling for Design, Operation and Safety Analysis of LWRs¡¯ (UAM). The developed capability uses a two-step approach. In the first step, Uncertainties in nuclear data are propagated to two-group cross sections, diffusion coefficients, and assembly discontinuity factors. This is carried out using deterministic, perturbation-theory-based uncertainty analysis methodology. In the second step, a global covariance matrix, characterizing the uncertainties of the group constants, is formed, and the uncertainties are propagated through a full core SIMULATE calculation using a stochastic approach. This system enables the analysis of nuclear data related uncertainties in assembly-homogenized group constants, assembly discontinuity factors, and pin powers, as well as full core results such as multiplication factor and power distribution. The mathematical background of the deterministic uncertainty analysis methodology is reviewed and the main conclusions related to the implementation are summarized. Numerical results are presented for the full core Three Mile Island model in exercise I-3 of the UAM benchmark at hot zero power with all rods out and inserted.

However, no previous investigation has assessed this association in older adults from Mediterranean countries, who show characteristic drinking patterns. Methods Data were taken from the UAM and the Seniors-ENRICA cohorts in Spain, comprising community-dwelling people aged ¡Ã60 years. At baseline, participants in both cohorts were classified as non-drinkers, ex-drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers (the threshold between moderate and heavy intake was ¡Ã40?g/day in men and ¡Ã24?g/day in women). The Seniors-ENRICA cohort allowed assessment of a Mediterranean Drinking Pattern (MDP), defined as moderate alcohol intake, with wine preference (¡Ã80% of alcohol consumed as wine) and drinking only with meals. The incidence of limitation in mobility, agility, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was ascertained in each cohort at the end of a 3.5-year follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, education, lifestyle, BMI, chronic conditions, and functional limitations at baseline others than the studied limitation. Results Compared with non-drinkers, ex-drinkers showed a higher risk of IADL limitation (pooled adjusted odds ratio [paOR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04?2.21). By contrast, moderate drinkers had a lower risk of limitations in mobility (paOR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63?0.97), agility (paOR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.65?0.99) and IADL (paOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39?0.69). Among individuals reporting poor or fair health, the MDP was associated with lower risk of mobility limitation (aOR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27?0.97). Conclusion In older adults, moderate alcohol consumption, as well as the MDP in specific subgroups, is associated with lower risk of functional limitation. These results should not serve to promote alcohol intake, because older adults are particularly vulnerable to its harmful effects. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",Alcohol; Cohort study; Functional limitations

Plant mutases belong to a small gene family called Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). So far, UAM has been identified in Oryza sativa (Rice), Arabidopsis thaliana and Hordeum vulgare (Barley). The enzyme requires divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Here, the divalent metal ion dependency of UAMs from O. sativa (rice) and A. thaliana have been studied using HPLC-based kinetic assays. It was determined that UAM from these species had the highest relative activity in a range of 40?80 ¥ìM Mn2 +. Excess Mn2 + ion concentration decreased the enzyme activity. This trend was observed when other divalent metal ions were used to test activity. To gain a perspective of the role played by the metal ion in activity, an ab initio structural model was generated based on the UAM amino acid sequence and a potential metal binding region was identified. Based on our results, we propose that the probable role of the metal in UAM is stabilizing the diphosphate of the substrate, UDP-Arap. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Enzyme kinetics; L-arabinofuranose; Metalloproteins; Plant mutase; Reversibly glycosylated polypeptides; Structure prediction; UDP-arabinopyranose mutase

For this purpose, in weak rocks and soils, the umbrella arch method (UAM) has been used in addition to the new Austrian tunneling method (NATM). NATM and UAM are the best-known classical methods used in tunnel excavation. In classical tunneling, NATM is usually preferred in normal rocks. However, in some cases, NATM may be insufficient. UAM is a very effective alternative especially in soils and weak rocks. In soil and weak rocks, UAM is especially necessary to prevent excessive deformations. Selection of UAM or NATM is based on the following factors: cost comparison of NATM and UAM, allowable deformations, quality of rock or soil, application time of NATM and UAM, availability of skilled workers, and qualification level of the workers. Therefore, selecting the excavation method in these kinds of grounds is vital in terms of achieving the project goals in time, managing the project costs effectively, and controlling the probable deformations on nearby structures. A critical issue in successful tunneling application is the ability to evaluate and predict the deformations, costs, and project time. In this paper, application times, costs, and deformation effects are compared between NATM and UAM in sensitive regions at the Uskudar-Umraniye-Cekmekoy metro project (UUCMP). Also, efficiency of the deformation control of UAM is demonstrated by using the 2D numerical analysis method. UUCMP is part of the Istanbul metro network. The tunnels have a cross section of 75.60?m2 for NATM and 83.42?m2 for UAM. Geology in this section is composed of weak sandstone. Diabase and andesite dykes are also rarely observed. This study shows that the construction cost of UAM are 1.7 times more expensive than NATM. Although application time of UAM is 2.5 times longer than NATM, it is 2.5 times more efficient in controlling the deformations. This efficiency in controlling the deformations is confirmed via two-dimensional numerical analyses. ? 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Application time; Cost comparison; Deformation; NATM; Numerical analysis; Umbrella arch method

It is critical that we understand the long-term effects of landscape management on the structure and composition of forest tree communities to ensure that these practices are sustainable. Furthermore, it is increasingly important to also consider effects of our management within the context of anticipated environmental changes, especially future climate. This study investigated two decades of tree community dynamics within a long-term, landscape-scale management experiment located in a temperate deciduous forest in southeastern Missouri, USA. This experiment tests three alternative landscape management systems: even-aged management (EAM), uneven-aged management (UAM), and no-harvest management (NHM). Specifically, we evaluated effects of landscape management alternatives on: (1) structural and compositional dynamics of the tree communities and (2) adaptability of the tree communities to projected climate change. Changes in the abundance of dominant species under these landscape management systems suggested a prevailing successional trend on these relatively xeric, oak-dominated landscapes. In the overstory layer, there was a decrease in the abundance of red oak species (Section Lobatae), mainly black oak (Quercus velutina Lam.) and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea Muenchh.), and an increase in white oak (Quercus alba L.) suggesting a shift to white oak dominance is underway. In the midstory and understory layers, flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) abundance declined substantially, while maples (Acer spp. L.) and several minor species increased. Declines in shortleaf pine populations indicated that regeneration harvesting is not regenerating this species. Experiment-wide changes in tree community composition suggest that adaptability to projected future climate may have increased over the first two decades of the MOFEP experiment under all management systems and that diverse management objectives can be realized through active management, including adaptation to climate change. However, future research is needed to test this working hypothesis and to more fully evaluate the impacts of silviculture treatments within the context of projected climate. ? 2016",Adaptation; Climate change; Landscape management; Oak forests; Silviculture; Succession

These methodologies have to consider the different associated regarding plant and representation uncertainties to code uncertainties. For this kind of analysis, stochastic theory developed by Wilks play a relevant role. Wilks studies are used to determine the influence of input variables on the target output variables. In addition, this method provides how many cases must be run according to the error band dimension and desired output parameters of the problem. The code DAKOTA is chosen to perform the Uncertainty and Sensitivity analysis. The most relevant input parameters are selected regarding recent research and experts criteria on the thermal-hydraulic analysis at sub-channel level.

For this work, it will be necessary to define an appropriate scenario where safety parameters, such as the void fraction, in LWR fuel bundles can be analyzed. Among the different exercises proposed in the UAM benchmark, void fraction is chosen for this work since it is an illustrative parameter related to the safety analysis.

However, this paper reviews different aspects in regard to unaccompanied minors in Germany from a socio-pedagogical perspective. Firstly, insights into statistical data are given that reveal how heterogeneous the group of young people arriving and living in Germany is, despite the fact that they are all labelled the same (as UAM). Secondly, the changing legal and political framework for UAM reception in Germany is outlined and discussed. Thirdly, there is a focus on clearance practices and care arrangements for which the child and youth care system takes the main responsibility. Since the body of German research on this topic is far from being satisfactory, the conclusion points out the main gaps and challenges for future research. ? 2017, Duisburg-Essen University.",

It focuses on the reception and support arrangements that are provided for these young people by local authorities, their experiences of care and the pathways they may take through care towards adulthood. Since most unaccompanied minors (UAM) come to the UK in their mid-teen years, preparation and planning for leaving care should be a central feature of the work undertaken by those social workers, foster parents and residential workers who provide them with support. In this context, evidence is provided on the challenges presented for preparation, planning and aftercare support that arise from the tensions inherent in child welfare and immigration policy and practice. The strategies young people develop to move forward with their life plans, despite continuing uncertainty about their right to residency, are also highlighted. Research on UAM is a relatively new field of enquiry. As such, the need for a sustained program of research, including longitudinal studies that capture young people's experiences into adulthood and their experiences of enforced return is emphasized. ? 2017, Duisburg-Essen University.",

In the second paragraph, the latest changes in the protection and assistance governance of UAM has been analysed, focusing on the Protection system for refugees and asylum seekers (SPRAR). UAM, regardless whether asylum seekers or not, are indeed integrated in SPRAR local projects for the second stage reception, ensuring high-profiled integration activities and taking care, leading the SPRAR to configured itself as the national reception system for all UAM. Eventually, new perspectives and approach to this issue are proposed, underlying the necessity to move towards an integrated system at national and local level, developing an holistic approach for the UAM integration. ? 2017, Duisburg-Essen University.",

In general, most of the mould and die material are made from hardened steel (~40-60 HRc). The high strength of these materials reduced the capability of the conventional machining technique. Poor machined surface and high tool wear rate are among the problems associated with the conventional machining of this material. To overcome these problems, this paper proposed a hybrid machining process by adding an ultrasonic transducer to the normal tooling system namely ultrasonic assisted machining (UAM). Experimental work consisted of a comparison between ultrasonic assisted machining and conventional machining for different parameters namely cutting speed, feed rate and machining depth in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in improving the surface roughness value for machining hardened AISI D2 material. 2 level factorial design with 3 factors was employed as the technique of design of experiment (DOE). The machining test showed that the presence of rotary ultrasonic assisted vibration significantly improved the machined surface roughness with up to 85% reduction in Ra value compared to the conventional machining process with the same cutting conditions. In addition, the macroscopic observation of machined surface showed that the surface produced from ultrasonic machining was uniform with consistent peak to peak value which improved the surface finish. ? 2017 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia.",Hardened steel; Surface roughness; Ultrasonic assisted vibration Machining

Because calibration requires speaker labels for training, speaker-clustering techniques were used to generate pseudo-speakers for learning calibration parameters in those cases where only unlabeled in-domain data was available. These methods performed well in the SRE16. It is unclear, however, whether those techniques generalize well to other data sources.

Recently, because of the application requirements, the study on the critical dynamics behaviors of RNNs has drawn special attention. The critical condition is that a discriminant matrix M1 (¥Ã) related with an RNN is nonnegative definite. Due to the essential difficulty in analysis, there were only a few critical results up to now. Further, nearly all of the existing dynamic results are with diagonally nonlinear requirements on the activation mappings, i.e., the activation mapping G should satisfy the strict necessary condition that G (x) = (g1 (x1), g2 (x2), ?, gN (xN)) T. This is because of the essential difficulty on the analysis of the energy function. The requirement is so strict and it limits the applications of RNNs. In this paper, under the critical conditions, some new global asymptotically stable conclusions are presented for RNNs without the diagonally nonlinear requirement on the activation mappings. The results present here not only improve substantially upon the existing relevant critical stability results, but also provide some further cognizance on the essentially dynamical behavior of RNNs, and further, enlarge the application fields of them. ? 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Neutronics calculations are in general performed over a volume-averaged temperature by ignoring this distribution. Such an assumption results in an uncertainty in reactor design parameters. In this study, the magnitude of this uncertainty is estimated by solving the heat equation with a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient coupled with a reactor physics code. The effect of radial fuel temperature distribution is investigated by representing the fuel region as multiregional. Uncertainty is investigated for various Pu contents of (U-Pu)O2 fuel, a mix of depleted U and reactor-grade Pu. The effect of Pu content on the uncertainty is studied. The PWR TMI-1 unit cell case from UAM test problems is used in the calculations. Results are obtained by using the discrete ordinate method. From the results, it was observed that uncertainties in reactor parameters (k¡Ä and Doppler coefficient) due to the use of no temperature gradient and in k¡Ä due to cross-sections decrease as Pu content increases. Moreover, it was calculated that uncertainty due to uniform temperature inside the nuclear fuel is about 7% of uncertainty due to cross-sections. ? 2017 T?B?TAK.",(U-Pu)O2 fuel; Cross-section; Doppler feedback; SCALE6; Temperature gradient; Uncertainty analysis

Working with the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, we obtained DNA barcodes from recently collected and authoritatively identified specimens in the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) Insect Collection and the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge collection. We submitted tissues from 4776 specimens, of which 81% yielded DNA barcodes representing 1662 species and 1788 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), of primarily terrestrial, large-bodied arthropods. This represents 84% of the species available for DNA barcoding in the UAM Insect Collection.

An assessment of the identification power of the library in its current state yielded fewer species-level identifications than expected, but the results were not discouraging. We believe we are the first to deliberately begin development of a DNA barcode library of the entire arthropod fauna for a North American state or province.

Mobility is one such service that is witnessing transformation towards an end user orientation, aiming for a seamless journey, from end to end, that crosses the boundaries between modes of transportation and transaction. In this paper, we focus on the role of aviation in the inter-modal end-to-end journey. In particular, we focus on a key enabler - a system wide information management system (SWIM) that is key to sharing data between the different modes of transportation, their systems, stakeholders and users. We assess the role of aviation in inter-modal mobility in two respects: (1) Aviation as a segment in an inter-modal journey. Air transportation is inter-modal since, as aircraft carry passengers from gate to gate, other modes of transportation are necessary to complete the journey between the gates and the end points of the trip. We will discuss the impact of connectivity and end user orientation on this traditional air transportation model. (2) Aviation serving end-to-end markets. As most inter-modal efforts have focused on urban mobility, where multiple modes of transportation compete and complement each other, aviation remained largely foreign to this integration. This is likely to change with the advent of urban air mobility (UAM), which promises to compete with other modes of transportation in the urban environment. This transformation will require end-to-end, user-oriented air travel models, unlike the traditional gate-to-gate models. We will expand on extending SWIM adopted for aviation to other modes of mobility as a core enabler for real-time data sharing across modalities, networks, and seamless mobility. SWIM has been a successful Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) technology for increasing information sharing among the stakeholders of the national airspace system (NAS). It enabled connecting the aircraft, the airline operators, and the service providers to increase collaborative and distributed decision making (CDM). Expanding such a technology to connect with and among the other modes of mobility and with passengers, will be key for enabling seamless mobility. ""SWIM consists of standards, infrastructure, and governance that enable the management of air traffic management (ATM)-related information and how it is exchanged between users"". This is an important concept as we start to exchange data between the airlines and add new entrants into the NAS such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and UAM and share information with other transportation networks. For example, exchanging data with the airlines through SWIM collaborative decision making (CDM) enabled automated sequencing and scheduling of flights. Moreover, this platform has enabled creating better prediction algorithms and helps air traffic controllers manage workload. The paper will identify and discuss a Seamless Mobility Information architecture expanding on the SWIM capabilities and model which is a key for end to end mobility. In addition, it will propose an application in disruption management that can be developed and researched. ? 2018 IEEE.",Data exchange; Disruption management; Multi-modal; Network; SWIM; Total mobility; UAM

In the long term with more UAM flights, air traffic control is expected to limit further growth of such operations. Therefore, a first research has been performed on energy-efficient trajectory optimisation for a given required time of arrival, as the arrival phase is the most safety-critical flight phase with much higher air traffic density and limited battery energy. However, research on the computation of the optimal required time of arrival (RTA) for eVTOL aircraft has not yet been performed. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters in commercial aviation, eVTOL aircraft have different flight dynamics, limited battery energy supply and a limited number of landing spots at a vertiport such as the top of high-rise buildings. This work is the first to utilise a mixed-integer linear program that computes the optimal RTAs for eVTOLs to safely separate them for minimum delay based on remaining battery state of charge and vertiport capacity. A concept of operations for vertiport terminal area airspace design is also proposed while making use of the existing energy-efficient trajectory optimisation tool.

The concept focusses on the integration of new airspace users (e.g., UAS and Urban Air Taxis) into uncontrolled airspace (here airspace G). The advantage of the proposed concept is that it opens up the airspace equally for lowly equipped and highly-equipped UAS. The concept gives incentives for UAS manufacturers and operators to invest in performance relevant technology, but doesn't exclude lowly equipped airspace users from entering the U-Space airspace. The concept behind this approach relies on efficient airspace segmentation and UAS performance modelling. Based on airspace characteristics (e.g. ground class, geofences, U-Space service availability, occurrence of VFR-traffic or other non-cooperative airspace users) the airspace is segmented into cells of similar requirements. Generally, each airspace user is modelled by an ellipsoid defining its individual performance parameters with regard to navigation, communication and the capability to detect other airspace users (cooperatively and uncooperatively). The lower the overall performance, the larger the resulting safety ellipsoid will be for the aircraft. As a result, an airspace cell might either be used solely by few aircraft with a large ellipsoid - reaching the cell's capacity - or several aircraft with smaller ellipsoids. This results in an airspace management which allows a lot of freedom at low density, but little freedom at high density. ? 2018 IEEE.",Performance based; Traffic management; U-Space; UAM; UTM

Solid/conventional ameloblastoma (AM) and unicystic ameloblastoma (UAM) are the most frequent benign epithelial odontogenic tumors located in the maxillary region, and their treatment usually consists of extensive surgical resection. Therefore, it is relevant to study molecular markers to better understand the biological behavior of these tumors. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the expression of proteins related to cellular proliferation: Ki-67 and MCM4-6 complex. Materials and Methods. An immunohistochemistry technique was performed, with antibodies against Ki-67, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM6, in 10 AM and 10 UAM tumors. The results were quantified using label index and analyzed statistically. Results. AM and UAM had greater expression of MCM6, followed by MCM5, MCM4, and Ki-67 (P <.05). Immunoexpression of Ki-67 and MCM5 was exclusively nuclear, whereas the expression of MCM4 and MCM6 was nuclear and cytoplasmic. Conclusion. The results suggest that MCM5 is a trustable cell proliferation marker with higher sensitivity compared with Ki-67 and may be useful to predict the biological behavior of AM and UAM. Despite this, further studies are necessary, including a correlation with clinical parameters to confirm these findings. ?

In literature, most of the existing approaches for expression recognition mainly rely on manual annotations by experts, which is both time-consuming and difficult to obtain. Hence, we propose an unsupervised framework for spontaneous expression recognition that preserves discriminative information for the videos of each expression without using annotations. Initially, a large Gaussian mixture model called universal attribute model (UAM) is trained to learn the attributes of various expressions implicitly. Attributes are the movements of various facial muscles that are combined to form a particular facial expression. Then, a concatenated mean vector called the super expression-vector (SEV) is formed by using a maximum a posteriori adaptation of the UAM means for each expression clip. This SEV contains attributes from all the expressions resulting in a high dimensional representation. To retain only the attributes of that particular expression clip, the SEV is decomposed using factor analysis to produce a low-dimensional expression-vector. This procedure does not require any class labels and produces expression-vectors that are distinct for each expression irrespective of high inter-actor variability present in spontaneous expressions. On spontaneous expression datasets like BP4D and AFEW, we demonstrate that expression-vector achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we also show that UAM trained on a constrained data set can be effectively used to recognize expressions in unconstrained expression videos. ? 1992-2012 IEEE.",Expression recognition; factor analysis; feature extraction; Gaussian mixture model; map adaptation; universal attribute model

Yet, such models still typically implement a discrete step between the last cognitive stage and motor implementation. This discrete step is implemented as a fixed decision bound that activation in the last cognitive stage needs to cross before action can be initiated. Such an implementation is questionable as it cannot account for two important features of behavior. First, it does not allow to select an action while withholding it until the moment is appropriate for executing it. Second, it cannot account for recent evidence that cognition is not confined prior to movement initiation, but consistently leaks into movement. To address these two features, we propose a novel neurocomputational model of cognitionaction interactions, namely the unfolding action model (UAM). Crucially, the model implements adaptive information flow between the last cognitive processing stage and motor implementation. We show that the UAM addresses the two abovementioned features. Empirically, the UAM accounts for traditional response time data, including positively skewed initiation time distribution, functionally fixed decision bounds and speed-accuracy trade-offs in button-press experimental designs. Moreover, it accounts for movement times, movement paths, and how they are influenced by cognitive-experimental manipulations. This move should close the current gap between abstract decision-making models and behavior observed in natural habitats. ? 2018 American Psychological Association.",Action selection; Adaptive information processing; Decision-making; Neurocomputational model; Reaching task

Due to the nature of lightweight and flexibility of micro flapping wing structures, elastic deformation as a result of aeroelastic coupling is inevitable in flapping motion. This effect can be significant and beneficial to the aerodynamic performance as revealed in the present investigation for a flexible flapping wing of variable camber versus a rigid one. Firstly a two dimensional (2D) unsteady aerodynamic model (UAM) based on potential flow theory has been extended from previous study. Both leading and trailing edge discrete vortices are included in the model with unsteady Kutta condition satisfied to fully characterize the unsteady flow around a flapping wing. A wall function is created to modify the induced velocity of the vortices in the UAM to solve the vortices penetration problem. The modified UAM is then validated by comparing with CFD results of a typical insect-like flapping motion from previous research. Secondly the UAM is further extended for a flexible flapping wing of camber variation. Comparing with a rigid wing in a prescribed plunging and pitching motion, the results show lift increase with positive camber in upstroke by mitigating negative lift. The results also agree well with CFD simulation. Thirdly the 2D UAM is extended to calculate the aerodynamic forces of a 3D wing with camber variation, and validated by CFD results. Finally the model is applied to aerodynamic analysis of a 3D flexible flapping wing with aeroelastic coupling effect. Significant increase of lift coefficient can be achieved for a flexible flapping wing of positive camber and twist in upstroke produced by the structure elastic deformation. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Aeroelastic coupling; Flapping wing; Unsteady aerodynamic model; Variable camber

Flow channel inserts made of SiC will be exposed to tritium from the Li transmutation, as well as to neutron and gamma radiation. Hence a critical issue for future fusion devices is to clarify hydrogen isotope behaviour in SiC under such conditions. The objective of the work presented here is to study the effect of ionizing radiation on the deuterium trapping in Reaction Bonded SiC in similar conditions as reactor materials. This effect is evaluated by studying the influence of ionizing radiation on deuterium trapping (for both implanted and loaded SiC samples). Moreover, it is investigated how deuterium trapping may be modified by displacement damage. The ionizing radiation effect on absorption has also been evaluated for samples pre-damaged by self-ion irradiation. The irradiation and implantation experiment have been carried out at the CMAM-UAM accelerator, and the Danfysik implanter and 2 MeV Van de Graaff electron accelerator at CIEMAT. Samples are analysed by thermal desorption spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to clarify the mechanisms involved in the trapping processes, depending on the different experimental conditions. The results for the deuterium loaded samples indicate that absorption is increased by ionizing radiation. When samples are pre-damaged by C+4 ions, deuterium absorption is increased in the form of Si-D according to SIMS results. Furthermore, the effect of ionizing radiation after deuterium implantation is an enhancement of the deuterium released from SiC. The deuterium release observed in this case is forming hydrocarbons during irradiations. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Desorption; Deuterium absorption; Deuterium implantation; Displacement damage; Ionization irradiation; Trapping

Task-oriented optimal control strategies can also further improve the flight time by generating energy-optimal coordinated motions. This paper addresses the dynamic modeling, trajectory tracking and control of an UAM that consists of an under-actuated rotary-wing UAV, with a novel pitch-hover-maneuvering capability, and a 2-DOF robotic arm. A decoupled velocity-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy is proposed for tracking a trajectory in the sagittal plane of the UAM while the UAV base pitch hovers in place. Conventional PD controllers were used to generate set-point velocity screws as the inputs to the MPC. A partitioned (but complete) dynamic model of the UAM was developed and used for implementing the proposed control strategy in a simulated environment. The MPC controller takes the force/torque exerted (by the arm) on the UAV base into account and augments the desired control inputs accordingly. The proposed control strategy provides the following advantages: (1) it can be implemented in real time since a linearized dynamic model of the UAV base is used, (2) it provides a generic control structure that can be applied to different classes of UAMs. ? 2018 IEEE.",

The accuracy of this approach is unclear. Methods Day of transplant sera from 211 complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch-negative patients were retrospectively analyzed for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) using Luminex technology. HLA were defined as UAM if DSA had mean fluorescence intensity above (I) 3000 (patients retransplanted and those with DSA against HLA class I and II) or 5000 (all other patients), (II) 5000 for HLA-A, -B, and -DR and 10 000 for HLA DQ or (III) 10 000 (all HLA). We then studied the accuracy of these algorithms to identify patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and graft loss. UAM were also determined in 256 transplant candidates and vPRA levels calculated. Results At transplantation, 67 of 211 patients had DSA. Of these, 31 (algorithm I), 24 (II) and 17 (III) had UAM. Nine (I and II) and 8 (III) of 11 early AMR episodes and 7 (I), 6 (II) and 5 (III) of 9 graft losses occurred in UAM-positive patients during 4.9 years of follow-up. Algorithms I and II identified patients with persistently lower glomerular filtration rate even in the absence of overt AMR. Of the waiting list patients, 22-33% had UAM with median virtual panel reactive antibody of 69.2% to 79.1%. Conclusions Algorithms I and II had comparable efficacy but were superior to Algorithm III in identifying at-risk patients at an acceptable false-positive rate.

Snatch thefts are complex actions containing attributes like walking, running etc. which are affected by actor and view variations. To capture the variation in these attributes in diverse scenarios, we propose to model snatch thefts using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a large number of mixtures known as universal attribute model (UAM). However, the number of snatch thefts typically recorded in a surveillance videos is not sufficient enough to train the parameters of the UAM. Hence, we use the large human action datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51 to train the UAM as many of the actions in these datasets share attributes with snatch thefts. Then, a super-vector representation for each snatch theft clip is obtained using maximum aposteriori (MAP) adaptation of the universal attribute model. However, super-vectors are high-dimensional and contain many redundant attributes which do not contribute to snatch thefts. So, we propose to use factor analysis to obtain a low-dimensional representation called action-vector that contains only the relevant attributes. For evaluation, we introduce a video dataset called Snatch 1.0 created from many hours of surveillance footage obtained from different traffic cameras placed in the city of Hyderabad, India. We show that using action-vectors snatch thefts can be better identified than existing state-of-the-art feature representations. ? 2018",Action recognition; Factor analysis; Gaussian mixture model; Snatch theft detection; Surveillance

Due to the vibration based bonding mechanism, the quality of components at each layer depends on the geometry of the structure. In-situ monitoring during and between UAM manufacturing steps offers the potential for closed-loop control to optimize process parameters and to repair existing defects. One interface that is most prone to delamination is the base/build interface and often UAM component height and quality are limited by failure at the base/build interface. Low manufacturing temperatures and favorable orientation of typical interface defects in UAM make ultrasonic NDE an attractive candidate for online monitoring. Two approaches for in-situ NDE are discussed and the design of the monitoring system optimized so that the quality of UAM components is not affected by the addition of the NDE setup. Preliminary results from in-situ ultrasonic NDE indicate the potential to be utilized for online qualification, closed-loop control and offline certification of UAM components. ? 2018 Author(s).",

Healthcare workforce scarcities present in these locations result in poor perioperative care access and quality. These scarcities also limit the capacity for progressive development and enhancement of workforce training, and skills through continuing medical education. Newly available low-cost, in-situ simulation systems make it possible for a small cadre of trainers to use simulation to identify areas needing improvement and to rehearse best practice approaches, relevant to the context of target environments. Methods: Nurse anesthetists were recruited throughout Sierra Leone to participate in simulation-based obstetric anesthesia scenarios at the country's national referral maternity hospital. All subjects participated in a detailed computer assisted training program to familiarize themselves with the Universal Anesthesia Machine (UAM). An expert panel rated the morbidity/mortality risk of pre-identified critical incidents within the scenario via the Delphi process. Participant responses to critical incidents were observed during these scenarios. Participants had an obstetric anesthesia pretest and post-test as well as debrief sessions focused on reviewing the significance of critical incident responses observed during the scenario. Results: 21 nurse anesthetists, (20% of anesthesia providers nationally) participated. Median age was 41 years and median experience practicing anesthesia was 3.5 years. Most participants (57.1%) were female, two-thirds (66.7%) performed obstetrics anesthesia daily but 57.1% had no experience using the UAM. During the simulation, participants were observed and assessed on critical incident responses for case preparation with a median score of 7 out of 13 points, anesthesia management with a median score of 10 out of 20 points and rapid sequence intubation with a median score of 3 out of 10 points. Conclusion: This study identified substantial risks to patient care and provides evidence to support the feasibility and value of in-situ simulation-based performance assessment for identifying critical gaps in safe anesthesia care in the low-resource settings. Further investigations may validate the impact and sustainability of simulation based training on skills transfer and retention among anesthesia providers low resource environments. ? 2018 The Authors",Africa; Anesthesia; Low-resource environment; Sierra Leone; Simulation; Training

Currently, the code is under development but some important steps have been made in the verification procedure of the code. A composite nodal method for prismatic hexagons has been developed and applied to solve the neutron diffusion equations for cores built by the union, side by side, of hexagonal prisms. A standard finite element method is used starting by the strong form to get the corresponding weak form. The verification and validation process of the AZNHEX code started with some academic exercises. In the case of this paper, in order to move to much more realistic scenarios, the OECD/NEA UAM Sodium Fast Reactor Benchmark has been used together with the SERPENT code for further verification. One of the exercises of the OECD/NEA Sodium Fast Reactor Benchmark is focused on the neutronic characterization of global parameters (keff, sodium void worth, Doppler, etc.) and feedback coefficient evaluation. This Benchmark is intended to confirm the ability of participants and their neutronic codes to provide generally consistent results when analyzing SFR core characteristics and thus, it represents a very good exercise for the AZNHEX development team. The differences in keff of AZNHEX versus the well validated deterministic codes DYN3D and PARCS are 70 pcm and 113 pcm respectively when using the same set of XS previously generated with the stochastic code SERPENT. Also, the radial power distribution compared between the deterministic codes over the main diagonal of the core presented very good agreement among them. In other exercises, differences in the order of 200 pcm, in the worst cases, were found when comparing integral parameters with SERPENT. The AZNHEX results give the confidence to keep developing the code in order to convert it into the standard domestic tool for hexagonal-z geometry core analysis. Future developments on the code will be focused on the implementation of discontinuity factors and the thermal expansion effects in an operating core as well as the time dependent implementation. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",AZNHEX for FR analysis; Hexagonal-z geometry solver; Neutron diffusion code AZNHEX; OECD/NEA UAM Sodium Fast Reactor Benchmark

In order to perform the analysis, two methodologies for nuclear data uncertainty quantification in stand-alone neutronics calculations have been implemented in the core simulator COBAYA. The first one is based on first-order perturbation theory and allows sensitivity/uncertainty analysis in the multiplication factor. The second one is based on random sampling and allows the uncertainty propagation in all responses computed by the code. Both methodologies are used in conjunction with SCALE system, which provides the capabilities to propagate the nuclear data uncertainties into the few-group constants required for the diffusion calculations. These methodologies are validated using a simplified pin-cell and a fuel assembly, and then applied to a full 3D core in the context of the OECD/NEA UAM benchmark (Uncertainty Analysis in Best-Estimate Modeling for Design, Operation and Safety Analysis of LWRs). ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Core simulator; Nodal and pin-by-pin; Perturbation theory-based method; Sampling-based method; Uncertainty quantification

Arabinose is a constituent of many different cell wall components, including pectic rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and II (RG-II), glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAX), and arabinoxyloglucan (AXG). Arabinose is found predominantly in the furanose rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. The UDP-arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs) have been demonstrated to convert UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) to UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The UAMs have been implicated in polysaccharide biosynthesis and developmental processes. Arabinose residues could be a component of many polysaccharides, including branched (1¡æ5)-¥á-arabinans, arabinogalactans in pectic polysaccharides, and arabinoxyloglucans, which are abundant in the cell walls of solanaceous plants. Therefore, to elucidate the role of UAMs and arabinan side chains, we analyzed the UAM RNA interference transformants in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The tobacco UAM gene family consists of four members. We generated RNAi transformants (NtUAM-KD) to down-regulate all four of the UAM members. The NtUAM-KD showed abnormal leaf development in the form of a callus-like structure and many holes in the leaf epidermis. A clear reduction in the pectic arabinan content was observed in the tissue of the NtUAM-KD leaf. The arabinose/xylose ratio in the xyloglucan-rich cell wall fraction was drastically reduced in NtUAM-KD. These results suggest that UAMs are required for Ara side chain biosynthesis in both RG-I and AXG in Solanaceae plants, and that arabinan-mediated cell wall networks might be important for normal leaf expansion. ? 2017, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK.",Arabinoxyloglucan; Nicotiana tabacum; Rhamnogalacturonan-I; UDP-arabinopyranose mutase

There is also evidence that music can enhance imagery (Grocke and Wigram, 2007), although few studies have investigated the effects of music on imagery in the context of sport skills. In the present study, the effects of relaxing and arousing music during imagery on dart-throwing performance, physiological arousal indices, and competitive state anxiety, were investigated among 63 novice dart throwers. Participants had moderate-to-high imagery ability and were randomly assigned to unfamiliar relaxing music (URM), unfamiliar arousing music (UAM), or no music (NM) groups. Performance was assessed by 40 dart throws at a concentric circles dartboard before and after 12 imagery sessions over 4 weeks. Measures of galvanic skin response (GSR), peripheral temperature (PT), and heart rate (HR) were taken during imagery sessions 1 and 12, and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 Revised (CSAI-2R) was administered prior to the pre- and post-intervention performance task. Dart-throwing gain scores were significantly higher for URM than for UAM and NM, with no significant difference between UAM and NM (URM = 37.24 ¡¾ 5.66, UAM = 17.57 ¡¾ 5.30, and NM = 13.19 ¡¾ 6.14, F2,62 = 5.03, p = 0.01, ¥ç2 = 0.14). GSR, PT, and HR reflected lower arousal for URM than for UAM or NM. Significant decreases in somatic anxiety were evident for URM and UAM but not NM. Significant decreases in cognitive anxiety were evident for URM and NM but not UAM. Significant increases in self-confidence were evident for URM but not UAM or NM. Performance improved in all three conditions but URM was associated with the largest performance gain, the lowest physiological indices of arousal, and the most positive CSAI-2R profiles.

However, it is also desirable to derive uncertainties of core simulation output parameters (e.g. enthalpy deposition in an REA) to nuclear data uncertainties for specific nuclide-reaction pairs. This allows the key uncertainly contributions to be identified and ranked. A novel methodology has been developed in WIMS to facilitate the efficient derivation of covarianccs between macroscopic cross sections and hence the development of sampled macroscopic cross sections for use in PANTHER.

This paper investigates potential operational constraints that could arise during the implementation or scale-up of a UAM system. Literature on helicopter passenger networks was reviewed to determine operational constraints experienced by prior services similar toUAM. A constraint analysis was applied to near-term UAM operations in Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas to assess if the historical constraints persist, or if novel constraints have emerged. The three city cases represented geographically diverse implementation regions for UAM services. A notional door-to-door concept of operations was applied to 32 reference missions within the three city cases. The reference missions exhibited a variety of requirements in terms of flight distance, passenger volume, market type, population overflight, and air traffic congestion, among others. By reviewing ground and flight operations for each reference mission, eight operational constraints were identified that could limit UAM system growth potential or prohibit UAM services altogether. The three most stringent constraints concerned community acceptance of aircraft noise, takeoff and landing area availability, and air traffic control scalability. ? 2018 by Parker Vascik.",

Currently, UAS configurations suffer from propulsive and aerodynamic limitations that decrease the payload weight and/or mission range. In order to decrease these limitations, the Kinetic and Potential Energy Alternation for Greater Lift Enhancement (KP EAGLE) concept provides a novel way to transport payloads that may be too heavy for vehicles in a similar weight class. The concept vehicle takes off vertically without the payload. It then performs a dive maneuver that transfers the gained potential energy into kinetic energy to pick up the payload. This concept does not require special equipment during takeoff or landing and provides a better payload to weight ratio than other conventional vehicles in the same weight class. ? 31st Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2018.

This evolutionary variability is strongly influenced by the structural properties of the site in the native structure, and it is quantified either through sequence entropy or through substitution rates. However, while the sequence entropy only depends on the equilibrium frequencies of the amino acids, the substitution rate also depends on the exchangeability matrix that describes mutations in the mathematical model of the substitution process. Here we apply two variants of a mathematical model of protein evolution with selection for protein stability, both against unfolding and against misfolding. Exploiting the approximation of independent sites, these models allow computing site-specific substitution processes that satisfy global constraints on folding stability. We find that site-specific substitution rates do not depend only on the selective constraints acting on the site, quantified through its sequence entropy. In fact, polar sites evolve faster than hydrophobic sites even for equal sequence entropy, as a consequence of the fact that polar amino acids are characterized by higher mutational exchangeability than hydrophobic ones. Accordingly, the model predicts that more polar proteins tend to evolve faster. Nevertheless, these results change if we compare proteins that evolve under different mutation biases, such as orthologous proteins in different bacterial genomes. In this case, the substitution rates are faster in genomes that evolve under mutational bias that favor hydrophobic amino acids by preferentially incorporating the nucleotide Thymine that is more frequent in hydrophobic codons. This appearingly contradictory result arises because buried sites occupied by hydrophobic amino acids are characterized by larger selective factors that largely amplify the substitution rate between hydrophobic amino acids, while the selective factors of exposed sites have a weaker effect. Thus, changes in the mutational bias produce deep effects on the biophysical properties of the protein (hydrophobicity) and on its evolutionary properties (sequence entropy and substitution rate) at the same time.

Some benefits were realized using the LNG's cryogenic properties to reduce some electrical component losses and cooling requirements. Significant questions were raised concerning volume and thermal management considerations for all studied systems. The notional, baseline vehicle was a hybrid helicopter / airplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), balancing high cruise efficiency with reasonable hover capability. A subsequent power system assessment using the same notional vehicle and mission was performed that identified increased volume and power requirements for the active cooling required. The cooling airflow could also generate additional drag on the vehicle during operation. For the notional vehicle studied, the additional volume identified by the subsequent study would not affect vehicle mold line and therefore drag. However, the additional drag from cooling airflow and the power to circulate it as needed would impact power system and vehicle mission performance. Vehicle and mission models were updated and rerun. Updated results still indicated significant benefits in range and number of UAM missions, but reduced the benefit by 12-15%. Hold time for the hybrid systems also generally increased a few minutes because of reduced power available for charging from the power for required cooling flows. Vehicle weights, thermal loads, and cooling airflows from the updated analyses were similar to previous results. Copyright ? 2017 by AHS International, Inc. All rights reserved.",

The development of these mission requirements provides justifiable assumptions that feed the second phase of the approach, which is performing aircraft conceptual design studies. Vehicle design is not included in this paper, but the work described here will define sizing missions for follow-on design and sizing studies. The aircraft that emerge from the design studies can then feed the third phase of our UAM analysis approach, which involves simulating an entire UAM network over a metropolitan area to study transportation-system level characteristics. Iteration between each of the three phases of the UAM analysis approach will be necessary to propagate lessons learned as our research progresses and as the UAM community coalesces on a more unified vision for UAM.

Traffic congestion in leading metro areas is increasing and leading to significant increases in commuting time and pollution. This leads to a renewed interest in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts of operations to improve efficiency and mitigate some of these concerns. Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft have been investigated extensively, but suffer from shortcomings related to rotor noise and overall vehicle energy efficiency. Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft present a unique capability to overcome some of these shortcomings, provided a viable concept of operations leading to tangible benefits to customers can be constructed.

Travel times are then compared for two modes of transportations: personal cars and a mix of ground ridesharing and air transportation using STOL aircraft. The sensitivity of the door-to-door travel time to airpark geo-density and various vehicle performance attributes is assessed to help derive requirements for future concepts of operations featuring STOL aircraft.

Significant investment and rapid development of vehicles for this activity is taking place, with package delivery services already beginning in some areas. However, the ability to manage thousands of these vehicles safely in a congested urban area presents a challenge unprecedented in air traffic management. Initial studies of this problem led by NASA under the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) initiative have primarily focused on geo-fencing and centralized reservation of airspace for individual flights. This paper proposes an extension of UTM using a de-centralized approach employing airborne surveillance, self-separation, and a minimized ¡°design separation¡± approach to permit the optimization and safety of each flight in very high traffic densities and close proximities. The concept employs Airborne Trajectory Management (ABTM) principles and a novel new concept for variable separation criteria to manage the angular velocity of a passing vehicle, thus eliminating the ""startle factor"" and perceived hazard of very close operations. ABTM also accomplishes most of the services required for safe planning and execution of normal flights and recovery from abnormal or emergency operations while accommodating conventional piloted flights using the current air traffic control paradigm. The environment for UAM operations is described along with the proposed means for autonomous, tactical separation of the vehicles.

UAM or ODM systems featuring these capabilities typically have a smaller ground footprint but are subject to a number of performance compromises that make sizing and optimizing the vehicles more challenging. These design challenges can be further compounded when additional environmental considerations are taken into account and in particular if electric propulsion is considered. Alternative architectures such as short takeoff and landing (STOL) and super-short takeoff and landing (SSTOL) vehicles are thus investigated because they present possible advantages in terms of energy efficiency, overall vehicle performance, and noise footprint. However, the larger ground footprint of the infrastructure necessary to operate these systems means that these systems may be more difficult to integrate into a urban and suburban environment. One objective of this research is to estimate the geo-density of airparks suitable for STOL and SSTOL operations based on vehicle performance and ground footprint parameters. In turn, this helps establish requirements for the field performances of STOL and SSTOL vehicles to be considered for ODM and UAM applications.

This model provides the ability to assess many parameters, including the number of vehicles needed in the system to meet demand, the number of vehicles airborne at any given time, and the length of time vehicles may have to loiter before a landing pad becomes available. We focus our initial studies with the model on exploring the UAM system-level implications of different energy storage systems on UAM vehicles. Specifically, we compare fully-battery-electric vehicles to vehicles with multiple hybrid-electric powertrains, which consist of different energy conversion systems (i.e., engines and fuel cells) and fuels. The transportation system-level model provides insight into vertiport ground infrastructure requirements, such as the number of recharging or refueling stations and the impact of various vehicle powertrains on these requirements. Ultimately, results indicate that the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel in a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell-battery-turbine system can result in a vehicle power system that provides lower operating costs, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and lower power system weights than pure batteryelectric solutions at the same power level while also having fewer infrastructure integration issues. Additionally, a hybrid internal combustion engine-generator-battery solution fueled with LNG provides a near-equivalent energy cost solution to pure battery-electric power systems at the same power level, but at a much lower system mass.

The architecture is an exploration of airspace features and air traffic control requirements that would need to be satisfied in order to enable orders of magnitude increases in aircraft operations. High density requires channelization of high-throughput portions of the airspace to manage pair-wise conflicts. This leads to the requirement to merge different streams of traffic without leading to congestion. Three-dimensional airspace provides an extra degree of freedom for merging that is not readily available for surface traffic, the paper describes algorithms and simulation results. Ascent and descent need to be accommodated in order for traffic to reach different channels, without requiring large volumes of airspace. An airspace construct ? elevators ? is described that minimizes the volume needed for ascent/descent, and thus maximizes the volume that can be devoted to high-throughput channelized traffic.

This paper identifies the primary mechanisms through which each constraint emerges to limit the number of UAM operations in an area (i.e. the scale of the service). Technical, ecosystem, or operational factors that influence each of the mechanisms are also identified. Interdependencies between the constraints are shown. Potential approaches to reduce constraint severity through adjustments to the mechanisms are introduced. Finally, an effort is made to characterize the severity of each operational constraint as a function of the density of UAM operations in a region of interest. To this end, a measure of severity is proposed for each constraint. This measure is used to notionally display how the severity of the constraint responds to UAM scaling, and to identify scenarios where efforts to relieve the constraint are most effective. The overall purpose of this paper is to provide an abstraction of the workings of the key UAM operational constraints so that researchers, developers, and practitioners may guide their efforts to mitigation pathways that are most likely to increase achievable UAM system scale. ? 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The highly-autonomous AutoResolver algorithm developed for traditional aviation was extended to provide these capabilities. An evaluation of this initial implementation was conducted in fast-time simulations using a dense, two-hour traffic scenario with Urban Air Mobility aircraft flying between a network of 20 vertiports in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. When the spatial separation was reduced from 0.3nmi to 0.1nmi, the total delay decreased by 7.3%; when the temporal separation was reduced from 60s to 45s, the total delay decreased by 28.4%. The total number of conflict resolutions decreased by 26% and 17%, respectively. Furthermore, when a scheduling horizon greater than the duration of UAM flights was used (50min), most conflicts were resolved pre-departure producing ground delay. By comparison, when a shorter scheduling horizon was used (8min), most conflicts were resolved post-departure generating airborne delay. For all scheduling and separation constraints tested, AutoResolver prevented loss of separation from occurring. Urban Air Mobility operations have the ability to revolutionize how people and goods are transported and this paper presents initial research focusing on the high levels of autonomy required for an airspace system capable of scaling to handle significantly higher densities of aircraft. ? 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Growth of the city population is leading to higher traffic volumes and a demand for improved transportation. In order to come up with a solution for the huge traffic in big cities, the idea of On-Demand Mobility (ODM) or the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has been introduced. In this idea, a portion of the transportation in cities is switching from the ground to the air. To make this happen, an air traffic management system is needed to control the traffic in the air. However, there are some challenges to face and one of them is the ICAO addressing for On-Demand Mobility. In this paper, a brief summary of the On-Demand Mobility and the ADS-B system for flying cars is discussed. Following that, some solutions are suggested and some simulations are conducted to figure out how the ICAO addressing works for flying cars. ? 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Air EMS can move patients or live organs more rapidly than surface modes over long distances or congested areas. Air EMS also provides unparalleled access to accident scenes in regions where surface transportation is compromised such as in the backcountry or during disaster scenarios. However, despite these unique capabilities, Air EMS is currently provided to only a small minority of the most critical medical cases. This is due to the high historical cost and risk of airborne operations. Air EMS costs are driven primarily by the high level of availability required of these services and their low utilization. The elevated accident rate compared to other forms of aviation is in large part due to the operation of these services to and from off-field landing areas with unmarked and perhaps unknown obstacles. This research investigates opportunities to increase the number of Air EMS operations provided in a region by reducing the cost per operation and increasing the level of care. Significant recent investments in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are maturing a new class of electric aircraft and automation technologies that may provide benefits to Air EMS operations. Furthermore, opportunities to deploy Air EMS assets as part of a UAM system to increase utilization and reduce costs through revenue management are also reviewed. Finally, potential pathways to leverage Air EMS as a proving ground and forcing function to overcome constraints in air traffic control and community acceptance for broader UAM services are discussed. The results of this study suggest that near-term electric aircraft are not expected to meet the requirements of the Air EMS mission and also provide little cost reduction potential for the industry. However, new operational models that leverage UAM markets and airline revenue management systems show promise to enhance Air EMS scale. Finally, flight automation technologies in development for UAM aircraft show potential to increase Air EMS safety. ? 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Fiber delamination and resin burning are the major difficulties associated with traditional machining processes of CFRP. Although dry cutting is preferable for cutting CFRP which not absorb cutting fluid and eliminate the need for subsequent cleaning, increasing cutting temperature leads to degradation, smearing, and burning of epoxy resin. This paper investigates the effect of different fluid delivery methods (MQL/flood) on ultrasonic assisted machining (UAM) of multidirectional CFRP laminates using diamond abrasive tools at different cutting conditions. The process parameters studied were cutting speed, feed rate, radial depth of cut, and cooling modes. Cutting forces, surface integrity, and bouncing-back effect were the output responses of this study. Statistical analysis was conducted to study the effect of each factor on the performance characteristics. The results showed that flood coolant provide better results than MQL. However, MQL responses still comparable with flood coolant. The conditions that gave the best responses of MQL were determined which can be utilized for near dry cutting demands. ? 2018 The Authors.

The bouncing-back effect of CFRP components is very challenging owing to spring back of trimmed edge after cutting tool pass. Ultrasonic assisted machining (UAM) is an efficient method used to enhance the quality of CFRP parts due to the reduced contact time between the tool and workpiece. This paper experimentally investigates the effect of edge trimming variables on the cutting forces and the magnitude of the bouncing back. Diamond abrasive end mills were utilized during ultrasonic assisted edge trimming of CFRP. The processes variables include spindle speed, feed rate, radial depth of cut, fiber orientations, and up/down strategy. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the most significant factor on performance characteristics. Regression equation was also developed to predict the value of bouncing back.
