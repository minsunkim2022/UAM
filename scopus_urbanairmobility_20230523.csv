Several eVTOL aircraft propelled using Lithium-ion batteries are under development. However, despite the early spotlight, the manufacturers need to ensure safe long-term operation of the vehicles including strict checks on battery-related hazards. On the other hand, fast charging of eVTOL batteries is crucial to enable multiple flights per day and justify the economics of UAM. This work is aimed at contextualising battery safety for eVTOL through the modification of a battery fault diagnosis algorithm for fast charging. The algorithm was developed in Parts 1 and 2 of the paper to use the charging cycle data for detecting disconnection faults but tested only for low charging currents. This paper adapts the algorithm for fast charging through a novel technique termed as Partial Incremental Capacity (PIC). The PIC method was developed using experiments at single cell and supercell level before integrating it into the algorithm. Finally, the fault detection ability of the adapted algorithm was validated using a real-life eVTOL battery module. Thus, the updated version of the algorithm facilitates fault diagnosis while charging fast, making it ideal for implementation in eVTOL. © 2023 The Authors","Electric aircraft; eVTOL; Fast charging; Fault diagnosis; Incremental capacity; Li-ion batteries"

These systems usually integrate multiple sensors to improve navigation accuracy and require the corresponding integrity monitoring architecture to ensure integrity. In response, we implement the Solution Separation-based Kalman filter integrity monitoring (SS-KFIM) technique to achieve fault detection and protection level evaluation for multi-sensor integrated navigation. In our implementation, the filter bank management strategies to handle sensor-in and sensor-out events are discussed. Besides, we consider the faults in state initialization and propagation phases aside from those at the measurement-update stage. Furthermore, our implementation can accommodate the cases where the all-in-view filter is not optimal in a least-squares sense. Simulations are conducted with an illustrative example where an inertial navigation system, global navigation satellite systems, and visual odometry are integrated for a UAM task. The results prove the high effectiveness and extended applicability of our implementation of the SS-KFIM algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Integrity monitoring; Kalman filter; Multi-sensor integrated navigation; Solution separation"

To support this emerging aviation application, concepts for UAS/UAM traffic management (UTM) systems have been explored. Accurately characterizing and predicting the microscale weather conditions, winds in particular, will be critical to safe and efficient operations of the small UASs/UAM aircrafts within the UTM. This study implements a reduced order data assimilation approach to reduce discrepancies between the predicted urban wind speed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model with real-world, limited and sparse observations. The developed data assimilation system is UrbanDA. These observations are simulated using a large eddy simulation (LES). The data assimilation approach is based on the time-independent variational framework and uses space reduction to reduce the memory cost of the process. This approach leads to error reduction throughout the simulated domain and the reconstructed field is different than the initial guess by ingesting wind speeds at sensor locations and hence taking into account flow unsteadiness in a time when only the mean flow quantities are resolved. Different locations where wind sensors can be installed are discussed in terms of their impact on the resulting wind field. It is shown that near-wall locations, near turbulence generation areas with high wind speeds have the highest impact. Approximating the model error with its principal mode provides a better agreement with the truth and the hazardous areas for UAS navigation increases by more than 10% as wind hazards resulting from buildings wakes are better simulated through this process. © 2023 The Author(s)","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Data Assimilation; Model Reduction; Principal Component Analysis; Urban Air Mobility; Variational Data Assimilation"

Self-reinforced composites (SRCs) are attracting attention due to their advantages in terms of price, lightness, disposal and recycling compared to carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs). In this study, a new concept for 100% polypropylene (PP) SRC was proposed to simultaneously improve the adhesive, tensile and impact properties of SRCs without undermining the advantages of SRCs. For this implementation, a facile engineering strategy using quad screw extrusion (QSE) capable of generating high shear stress was employed to modify the melting temperature and impregnation properties of the PP matrix via controlling polymer chain structure. As the screw rotation speed of QSE increased, low molecular weight polymer chains with uniform chain lengths were prepared, which led to a decrease in the melting temperature of the PP matrix and an increase in the flowability and impregnation property of the matrix. Using this strategy, the adhesive strength, tensile strength and impact resistance of the optimized SRC improved by 333%, 228%, and 2700%, respectively. Racing drone flight experiments with the SRC and CFRP frames illustrated the advantages of the SRC frame such as the increase of the flight time due to low density of the SRC, the excellent impact resistant characteristics (which improves user safety), and the superior electrical insulation properties suitable for frequency transmission and reception. Therefore, the proposed SRC can be an ideal choice as a lightweight structural material for future mobility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Drone; Future mobility; Lightweight structural material; Self-reinforced composite"

Given the dynamic nature of urban air mobility in terms of decision-making time limit, wind dynamics and other external factors, one should consider their safe and efficient operations in an urban context. Therefore, we propose an energy-efficient path-planning model for UAVs under large and complex urban environments and wind dynamics. The proposed method adopted Voronoi Diagram to decompose the complex urban environment into a simplified network model, given the presence of no-fly zones and restricted areas as obstacles. One could obtain the feasible initial path by solving the network model using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm concerning the distance matrix. Given the nonlinearity of energy consumption along a path. We further model the UAV energy consumption and propose an efficient particle swarm optimisation (PSO) metaheuristic algorithm to achieve better solution quality. Compared to traditional PSO, the proposed algorithm achieved a 5% to 22% improvement under different wind scenarios by simulating real-life situations. In conclusion, the proposed method can achieve safe UAV operations with sufficient separation and less energy consumption. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic wind turbulence and disturbance; Energy efficiency; Path planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Urban air mobility; Wind dynamic"

Technological forecasting suggests that commercial services are fast emerging to transform urban and regional air mobility for people and cargo. However, the complexities of diverse design choices pose a challenge for potential adopters or service providers because there are no objective and simple means to compare designs based on the available set of performance specifications. This analysis defines an aeronautically informed propulsion efficiency index (PEX) to compare the performance of eVTOL designs. Range, payload ratio, and aspect ratio are the minimum set of independent parameters needed to compute a PEX that can distinguish among eVTOL designs. The distribution of the PEX and the range are lognormal in the design space. There is no association between PEX values and the mainstream eVTOL architecture types or the aircraft weight class. A multilinear regression showed that the three independent parameters explained >90 % of the PEX distribution in the present design space. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Advanced air mobility; Aerodynamic efficiency; Multilinear regression; Regional air mobility; Smart cities; Urban air mobility"

Researching the intention to use air vehicles is not easy, as it is a new mode of transport that has not yet been implemented, so there are no available observed data. This fact is why the many gaps and uncertainties remain unexplored in academic research on this topic. The most critical issues for the successful implementation of a UAM transport system is public acceptance and user adoption. Based on technology adoption theories, this paper investigates critical constructs in generating usage intention to use urban air autonomous vehicles (UAAVs) and the mediator role of pro-environmental behavior and human values in this relationship. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used with a sample from the US and China. The results confirm that attitudes, performance expectancy, and social influence reinforce the intention to use UAAVs, while anxiety reduces it. The UAAV acceptance model is very similar between the Chinese and US populations. The only difference between the two samples is that social influence has a positive and significant effect on intention to use among US people. At the same time, this variable is not essential in the Chinese sample. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Covariance-based structural equation modeling; Human values; Intention to use; Pro-environmental behavior; Urban air autonomous vehicles"

To mimic the atmospheric flow with realism, large-eddy simulation was employed along with an immersed boundary method to construct the presence of the building arrays. Four cases were studied which included an array of three high-rise buildings and three other combinations of high-rise and low-rise building arrays. Horseshoe vortex and recirculation flows were found in all building configurations whose intensity varied according to the upstream building height. In particular, the clockwise-rotating vortex was found to be dominant within the cavity between the buildings. In addition, the lateral vortex generated by the side walls of the non-uniform array tilted outward due to the secondary flow formed by the wake of the building, which additionally contributed to the downwash flow behind the building array. Elevated velocity fluctuations were found on top of and behind the high-rise buildings which persisted further downstream in parallel with the freestream flow. The largest velocity standard deviation was found to be 3.8 times that of the inflow which was due to the combination of flow recirculation and the wake from the further upstream building. Finally, the velocity spectra were analyzed to provide reference data for the deployment of vertiports and the UAM take-off and landing guidance. © 2023","Atmospheric boundary layer; Building arrangement; Large eddy simulation; Urban air mobility"

However, in addition to the safe design of vehicles, efficient operation must also be achieved by matching passenger requests to unoccupied and suitable vehicles. In the agent-based transportation simulation MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation), a rule-based approach has been followed by assigning the nearest available vehicle to each passenger request. Sophisticated considerations such as pooling multiple passengers with identical trip requests in terms of time and location or the urgency of a request were only partially considered or not considered at all. To decrease operating costs, especially by reducing the number of passenger flights and avoiding relocation flights, appropriate dispatching is essential for efficient assignment of available vehicles to trip requests. For this purpose, the suitability of the Bipartite Matching Dispatcher (BMD), already proven for ground-based on-demand mobility concepts, was investigated for application to UAM systems by demonstrating its performance on an existing data set using a mock-up simulation and comparing it to the initial dispatcher in MATSim. Studies have not only shown the similarity between UAM and ground-based on-demand operations, but also the compatibility of BMD for high load traffic scenarios with undersized fleets. Insights on the impact of available information, for example, the prioritization of early-submitted requests over urgent requests, on the operator's point of view can be concluded. For an efficient vehicle assignment, the consideration of passengers’ attitude towards possible comfort restrictions due to longer waiting times and incentives through price adjustments is of crucial importance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dispatching; Transportation simulation; Urban air mobility; Vehicle assignment"

This framework is applied to a conceptual UAM airspace configuration, where a free-flight-based routing service and a corridor-based routing service are dynamically allocated to control different portions of the airspace over time, based on traffic demand. This allocation seeks to determine the least amount of structured coordination (in terms of active flight corridors) needed to safely meet traffic demand. This framework integrates several modeling components, including a novel spatiotemporal graph theoretic UAM traffic model capable of optimizing vehicle trajectories while maintaining multiple flight constraints. Airspace complexity and trajectory efficiency metrics are both implemented to quantify the overall safety and cumulative cost of routing a set of missions according to a given airspace configuration. Finally, spatial airspace partitions are managed using a support vector machine-based algorithm. Metrics are then applied to optimize the airspace configurations, according to desired objectives. Simulated results show that this framework can produce airspace configurations that ensure safety, while providing trajectory efficiency more effectively than purely uniform free-flight or corridor-based flight. This is demonstrated for both low-and high-density traffic scenarios. © 2023, AIAA International. All rights reserved.",

Throughout the twentieth century, there was copious debate surrounding the rights of property owners and the authority of aviation regulatory agencies to govern airspace. The invention of the airplane and a burgeoning concern about aerial trespass vigorously fueled that debate. In the contemporary context, airspace ownership questions center primarily on debates over low-altitude airspace and subsequent legal remedies available for improper use, illegal entrance, or unwanted occupation of that airspace. This review examines the history of airspace ownership controversies in the United States through an analysis of legal cases, scholarly debates, academic journal articles, and primary sources. The purpose of this paper is to assist aviation scholarly and industry personnel in forming a better understanding of the historical and contemporary debates that have surrounded the question of airspace rights. It is a particularly meaningful time to review this area of aviation legal history because the advent of novel aviation technologies—namely, drones, Urban Air Mobility (UAM), and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) air taxis—is creating an industry ripe for new airspace ownership and control controversies in the coming decades. © 2023, University Aviation Association.

Appropriate distribution of thrust (realized via differential rotor speeds) to the upper and lower rotors results in approximately 5% savings in total power. Under this condition the thrust distribution is approximately 60% by the upper rotor and 40% by the lower rotor (which occurs when the lower rotor shaft speed is roughly 10% higher than the upper rotor shaft speed). Similar ratios were obtained in both the analytical solution and in experiment, at various total thrust levels.

The paper investigates hybrids of classical root-finding methods: the bisection, fixed-point and Newton-Rapson methods for use in eVTOL aircraft sizing. The improved convergence efficiency of the hybrid methods is at least 70% faster than the standard methods. This improved efficiency is significant for complex sizing problems. The developed sizing method is used to investigate the comparative performance of the wingless and powered lift eVTOL aircraft types for varying mission lengths. For a generic air taxi mission with a payload of 400 kg, the powered lift type demonstrates its mass efficiency when sized for missions above 10 km in range. However, the simpler architecture of the wingless eVTOL aircraft type makes it preferable for missions below 10 km in range when considering energy efficiency.

One of the approaches can be the use of electric ducted fans (EDFs), especially in, but not limited to, the case of unmanned aerial vehicles with vertical takeoff and landing. This concept has been known for several decades but has been used very little and therefore has been almost unexplored. This opens up opportunities for investigating the performance characteristics, electrical consumption or efficient thrust vectoring of EDFs with respect to their design and operational use. The presented study therefore deals with the influence of the EDF design change on its performance characteristics. These design changes mainly concerned the geometry of the cowling, i.e., reduction and increase of outlet cross section, and arrangement of fans, i.e., one- and two-rotor specification. The comparison was based on measuring of vertical thrust and power consumption during static testing. The results showed that the increasing outlet is the most suitable construction for the generation of vertical thrust during static testing, considering the specifically used EDF construction arrangement. Based on the findings, it can also be concluded that EDFs are a suitable option for use in unmanned aircraft as a competition to other propulsion systems. © 2023 by the authors.","3-D printing; electric ducted fan; engine; performance; propulsion systems; thrust; unmanned aircraft; urban air mobility"

Based on the potential air taxi demand estimated by prior studies, 14 unique sites are identified by an unsupervised machine learning technique called clustering large applications (CLARA) in Step-1. However, developing all the suggested stations simultaneously might be challenging for any business, and therefore, an integer programming model is developed in Step-2 to propose opening these centers in multiple phases, considering parameters such as rental cost, daily number of trips, easy access to road facilities, and employee salary, while maximizing the demand satisfaction. Sensitivity analysis is then conducted to identify the impact of various market penetration strategies (such as aggressive, defensive and balanced), inflation in the rental cost and employee salary, and the emergence of latent demand on the phased opening of the facilities. The clustering algorithm results indicate seven air taxi facilities to be established in the Manhattan borough, four in Queens, two in Brooklyn, and one in New Jersey, spread across three phases. Larger vertiports are suggested for airports, such as John F Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports, since they serve approximately 55% of the overall demand.

In this perspective, this study investigates the Environmental Life Cycle Costs of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) services to evaluate their potential integration with other transport systems, in the three-time horizons (2025, 2030, 2035). The key area of research was focused on the determination of the cost components of UAM required to calculate the unit costs of UAM transportation. To this end, unitary data and the method from a 2017 EC DG MOVE's report on urban accessibility have been adopted. The analysis confirms that most of the cost is related to the aircraft energy consumption during flight, while the rest is used by ground infrastructure. Moreover, the energy cost is strongly correlated with the distance travelled and the size of the aircraft. The longer the flight and the bigger the aircraft, the higher is the energy cost.

For this purpose, three use cases in the metropolitan area of Hamburg showcase representative applications of an AAM system, whereby a flight trajectory model calculates a flight time in each case. The direct operating cost are investigated for each use case individually and are sub-classified in five categories: fee, crew, maintenance, fuel and capital costs. Here, each use case has its own cost characteristics, in which different cost elements dominate. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis shows the effect of a variation of the flight cycles and load factor, that influences the costs as well as the airline business itself. Based on the occurring cost, a profit margin per available seat kilometer lead to a necessary fare per km, that an airline has to charge. © 2023 by the authors.","advanced air mobility; airport shuttle; cost modeling; direct operating cost; intra-city; profit margin; regional mobility; ticket price; urban air mobility"

To ensure the safety and autonomy of such missions, control challenges including fault tolerance and windy conditions must be addressed. This paper presents an observer-based optimal control approach for the active combined fault and wind disturbance rejection, with application to a quadplane unmanned aerial vehicle. The quadplane model is linearised for the longitudinal plane, vertical takeoff and landing and transition modes. Wind gusts are modelled using a Dryden turbulence model. An unknown input observer is first developed for the estimation of wind disturbance by defining an auxiliary variable that emulates body referenced accelerations. The approach is then extended to simultaneous rejection of intermittent elevator faults and wind disturbance velocities. Estimation error is mathematically proven to converge to zero, assuming a piecewise constant disturbance. A numerical simulation analysis demonstrates that for a typical quadplane flight profile at 100 m altitude, the observer-based wind gust and fault correction significantly enhances trajectory tracking accuracy compared to a linear quadratic regulator and to a H-infinity controller, which are both taken, without loss of generality, as benchmark controllers to be enhanced. This is done by adding wind and fault compensation terms to the controller with admissible control effort. The proposed observer is also shown to enhance accuracy and observer-based rejection of disturbances and faults compared to three alternative observers, based on output error integration, acceleration feedback and a sliding mode observer, respectively. The proposed approach is particularly efficient for the active rejection of actuator faults under windy conditions. © 2023 by the authors.","active disturbance rejection; actuator fault; LQR; observer; optimal control; quadplane; transitioning; UAV; wind disturbance"

This paper seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between public knowledge and the awareness of, and engagement with, drones, alongside the concerns and support for their use in city logistics. A survey was carried out in Portugal of the citizens with a view to better understanding their attitude towards such a goal. The survey revealed a positive attitude towards the use of drones in city logistics and that socio-demographic characteristics, namely gender, education level, job occupation, age, and home location are not directly correlated with citizens’ attitudes. Moreover, citizens revealed that they favour a potential environmental benefit over a reduction in delivery time, which they would be willing to pay for.

With the advent of modern RF hardware and advanced processing techniques, however, modern studies have experimentally demonstrated TWR systems with an unprecedented, sub-centimeter ranging precision with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) consumer-grade hardware.

In this study, a three-dimensional multiphase model of the heat pipe cooled PEMFC is built to evaluate the impact of three internal structures, layered, spaced, and composite, of ultra-thin heat pipes on system performance. The results show that the heat pipe cooling with the composite structure yields a lower thermal resistance and a larger operating range for the PEMFC system compared to other internal structures because of more rational layout of the internal cavity. In addition, the relationship between land to channel width ratio (LCWR) and local transport property is analyzed and discussed based on composite structural heat pipes.

To enable efficient operation, the aircraft flight performance is integrated into the process of multi-resolution airspace design, trajectory generation, conflict management, and MARL learning. The demand and capacity balancing (DCB) issue, separation conflict, and block unavailability introduced by wind turbulence are resolved by the proposed the multi-agent asynchronous advantage actor-critic (MAA3C) framework, in which the recurrent actor-critic networks allow the automatic action selection between ground delay, speed adjustment, and flight cancellation.

First, the acceptable GPS-induced deviation is calculated to meet the safety tolerance by analyzing the distributions of GPS-induced deviation under different signal quality levels. Second, a dynamic modeling and simulation method is applied to assess the wind impact on the track deviation accurately. The wind-induced deviation is calculated using a wind effect model considering surface friction and turbulence. Results show that the proposed model can reduce airspace conserveness by providing 45 percent available blocks more than the previous model.

These characteristics are frequently derived from the flying car’s Ducted Fan Lift System (DFLS). This study aims to develop a method for the rapid design and the evaluation of the aerodynamic performance of the DFLS, to support the preliminary scheme demonstration of the ducted fan flying car. The proposed method uses blade element theory to design the unducted fan and applies momentum theory to calculate the aerodynamic thrust of the DFLS. The DFLS of a 1:3 scale verifier for a flying car scheme was designed and evaluated using the proposed method and a numerical method, respectively. To validate the proposed method, a prototype of the scale DFLS was manufactured and tested, and the result was compared with those of the proposed theoretical method and the numerical method. This study demonstrates that while both the theoretical and numerical methods are capable of designing an unducted fan accurately, the theoretical method is simpler and faster.

When evaluating the DFLS, the accuracy of the numerical calculation is reduced, and the difference is greater than 30% at low power.

One main contribution of this article is the introduction of hourly passenger throughput per area as a performance indicator that allows to compare vertiports of different sizes.

In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as <italic>corridors</italic>, that link the aerodromes, thus avoiding the use of complex routing strategies such as those of modern-day helicopters and alleviating the burden on the ground transportation system. For safety, a UAM aircraft must use air-to-ground communications to report flight plan, off-nominal events, and real-time movement to ground base stations (GBSs). A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a suitable spatial model is proposed. For the considered setup, assuming that any given aircraft communicates with the closest GBS, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft&#x2019;s turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines.

One big challenge is that new aerial vehicles (AV) will quickly saturate the already crowded aviation spectrum, which is an essential resource to ensure reliable communications for safe air operations. In this paper, we consider an air transportation system where multiple AVs are operated to transport passengers or cargo from different sources to destinations along their pre-defined paths. During the flight, the minimum communication Quality of Service (QoS) must be achieved at all times to ensure flight safety. Our objective is to minimize the total mission completion time by jointly optimizing the velocities and spectrum allocation for all AVs. We formulate the optimization problem as a multi-stage Markov game where the optimization variables are coupled together. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning VD3QN algorithm is proposed to enable cooperative learning among AVs. Additionally, we propose a heuristic greedy algorithm (HGA) and an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) solution as baseline solutions. Extensive simulation results show that our learning-based solution outperforms the baseline solutions under different network configurations.

These factors can be found among such cost areas as investments (infrastructure, aircraft), operational, energy, end of life, delay and environmental. Once determined, they can be of great value for all UAM stakeholders, including manufacturers, urban planners and air service providers. Design/methodology/approach: The obtained results were based on the outcomes of ASSURED-UAM project. Having the information about the magnitude of each cost category, we were able to identify the most costly factors of UAM. As a result, it was possible to suggest feasible cost reduction means. Findings: For each cost category, there is the possibility to lower its value among the total cost of UAM. Each cost category has its own cost reduction means. It is vital however that the obtained results depend strongly on the assumptions made at the beginning of cost calculations.

Due to this reason, variable-speed rotor (VSR) technology is becoming popular, especially among urban air mobility vehicles. However, one of the biggest challenges of a VSR is the vibration of the rotor blade when it passes through a resonance point. A detailed study on the characterization of these resonances was performed by the authors (“Performance Advantages and Resonance Analysis of a Variable Speed Rotor Using Geometrically Exact Beam Formulations,” Journal of American Helicopter Society, Vol. 67, May 2022, Paper 042006). In this study, methods of reducing loads during resonance crossings are explored. The rotor model is built in Dymore, which is a multibody dynamics simulation tool. The geometrically exact beam theory is used to model the rotor blades as one-dimensional beams. Peters et al.’s(“Finite State Induced Flow Models Part I: Two-Dimensional Thin Airfoil,” Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 32, No. 2, March–April 1995, pp. 313–322) unsteady aerodynamics model with finite-state inflow and dynamic stall is used to obtain the aerodynamic loads acting on the rotor. Load reduction studies were carried out by varying the transition time, structural damping, and lag stiffness of the blade. The longer the rotor took to traverse a resonance region, the greater were the resonance loads. However, there were torque limitations on how quickly a rotor could pass through resonance. Increasing the structural damping was a very effective way of reducing the resonance loads. Increasing the lag stiffness of the rotor blade deteriorated the torque response due to 4/rev crossings. Combination studies were performed by combining the ideal transition times with 7% lag damping. © 2023, AIAA International. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we introduce the time-dependent aircraft performance over operational lifetime diagram, which is a means of integrating battery lifetime modeling into the assessment of all-electric aircraft meant to service commuter routes: both within polycentric metropolitan regions and between residential and commercial spaces. Four aircraft representing the major configuration classes of urban air mobility concepts were simulated under continuous operation spanning one year. The aircraft flew eight daily flights, with recharging of the battery pack occurring at the end of each flight. The behaviors exhibited by the aircraft powertrains offer more holistic perspectives on the limitations of battery-powered aircraft than other traditional, nontemporal methods. This study highlights that, depending on the vehicle configuration, range, and battery pack size, the battery life of achievable missions can fall by as much as 45%. Additionally, the findings reveal that the rate of change in an operational lifetime can range between 8 and 23 days per nautical mile flown.

The maximum sorties of logistics UAVs that can be served by the air route network are the upper-bound model objective, namely, the maximum flow of the logistics UAV air route network. The impedance function is constructed by considering safety and efficiency factors, and the lower-bound model objective function with the minimum logistics UAV air route network impedance value. An improved particle swarm optimization(PSO) algorithm is combined with the method of the successive algorithm(MSA) for solving the bi-level optimization model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm, a simplified logistics UAV air route network is built. The results show that the proposed algorithm obtains reliable results after 26 iterations, and most segments capacity utilization rate is more than 70%. Parametric analysis of safe separation and algorithm population size shows that the capacity of logistics UAV air route network decreases with the increase of safe separation and the decreasing trend is gradually slowed down, and the optimal algorithm population size corresponding to different safe separations also varies.

The purpose of this study is to provide an initial assessment of the infrastructure opportunities of UAM in southern California with different mixes of spatial constraints, such as noise levels, school buffer zones, and airspace zones. The corresponding travel demand that can be potentially captured under each scenario is estimated with a home–workplace trip table. The results of the analyses indicate that supply-side infrastructure opportunities, such as heliports and elevated parking structures, are widely available to accommodate the regional deployment of UAM services.

This is because the use of digital twins in the operation and control of UAM vehicles is essential for the UAM operational digital twin infrastructure (UAM-ODT). There are several issues that need to be addressed in this process: (i) the lack of digital twin engines for the digitalization (twinization) of the dynamics and control of UAM vehicles at the core of UAM-ODT systems; (ii) the lack of back-end system engineering in the development of UAM vehicle DTs; and (iii) the lack of fault-tolerant mechanisms for the DT cloud back-end system to run uninterrupted operations 24/7. On the other hand, software aging and rejuvenation are becoming increasingly important in a variety of computing scenarios as the demand for reliable and available services increases. With the increasing use of containerized systems, there is also a need for an orchestrator to support easy management and reduce operational costs. In this paper, an operational digital twin (ODT) of a typical urban air mobility (UAM) infrastructure is developed on a private cloud system based on Kubernetes using a proposed cloud-in-the-loop simulation approach. To ensure the ODT can provide uninterrupted operational control and services in UAM around the clock, we propose a methodology for investigating software aging in Kubernetes-based containerized clouds. We evaluate the behavior of Kubernetes software using the Nginx and K3S tools while they manage pods in an accelerated lifetime experiment. We continuously execute operations for creating and terminating pods, allowing us to observe the utilization of computing resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and I/O), the performance of the Nginx and K3S environments, and the response time of an application hosted in those environments. In some conditions and for specific metrics, such as virtual memory usage, we observed the effects of software aging, including a memory leak that is not fully cleared when the cluster is stopped. These issues could lead to system performance degradation and eventually compromise the reliability and availability of the system when it crashes due to memory space exhaustion or full utilization of swap space on the hard disk. This study helps with the deployment and maintenance of virtualized environments from the standpoint of system dependability in digital twin computing infrastructures where a large number of services are running under strict continuity requirements. © 2023 by the authors.","cloud-in-the-loop simulation; K3S; Kubernetes; Nginx; operational digital twin; software aging; software rejuvenation; urban air mobility"

The turbulent flows and gusts around buildings and other urban infrastructure can affect the steadiness and stability of such air vehicles by generating a highly transient relative flow field. Our aim is to review existing gust models, then consider gust encounters in the vicinity of buildings as experienced by flight trajectories over the roof of a nominally cuboid building in a suburban atmospheric boundary layer. Simplified models of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft are used to illustrate the changes in lift and thrust experienced by flight around the building. The analysis showed that fixed-wing aircraft experienced a substantial increase in angle of attack over a relatively short period of time (<1 s) as they fly through the shear layer at a representative forward velocity, which can be well above typical stall angles. Due to the slow flight speeds required for landing and take-off, significant control authority of rotor systems is required to ensure safe operation due to the high disturbance effects caused by localized gusts from buildings and protruding structures. Currently there appears to be negligible certification or regulation for AAM systems to ensure safe operations when traversing building flow fields under windy conditions and it is hoped that the insights provided in this paper will assist with future certification and regulation. © 2022 by the authors.","advanced air mobility; air taxi; buildings; certification; CFD; city; gust; infrastructure; limitation; regulation; severe; survey; turbulence; UAV; urban; urban air mobility; vertiports"

The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to present a novel rapid CRP blade shape optimization framework and (ii) to study the impact of the dual propellers revolution speed allocations on the overall CRP power efficiency. The core of the framework is the blade element momentum theory (BEMT)-based blade shape optimization considering the wake effect of the upper propeller by the rotational CFD (computational fluid dynamics) actuator-disc simulation method. The results show that for the same thrust, the optimized CRP at the equal revolution speed is superior to the original (upper-lower-identical) one by 5.9% in thrust-to-power ratio. The overall efficiency can be additionally lifted by 5.3% when the dual propellers share similar torques.

As a result, the ability to provide a satisfactory user experience through video streaming platforms is critical and complex. This requires continuously operating services while handling numerous user requests for near real-time video streaming. At the same time, high-quality video with high resolution and minimal interruptions is often expected. Therefore, the availability and performance (i.e., performability) of the Back-End video streaming infrastructure are crucial parameters for these platforms. However, evaluating novel video-on-demand architectures in real-world scenarios can be costly due to the numerous parameters involved. Analytical models, such as stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), can serve as an alternative in this complex scenario as they can be used to analyze systems during the design process. In this study, we developed a set of SPN models to assess the performance of a video-on-demand system. These models were designed to illustrate and to evaluate a video-on-demand architecture while considering performance. We had a base SPN model as well as three enhanced variants available.

The DoE identified the factors with the greatest impacts on performance, and the most significant factor interactions. Redundancy strategies were applied to the extended models to increase the availability of the most important components. This redundancy increased the availability of “9 s” from three to five.

A major challenge for UAM is to ensure reliable two-way wireless communications between aerial vehicles and their associated ground air traffic control centers for safe operations. The concept of cellular-based UAM (cUAM) provides a promising solution for reliable air-ground communications in urban air transportation, where each aerial vehicle is integrated into an existing cellular network as a new aerial user, sharing the cellular spectrum with existing terrestrial users. Generally, the additional aeronautical use of cellular spectrum can introduce harmful interference to current terrestrial communications, which only amplifies the severity of spectrum scarcity issues. Therefore, a new spectrum management solution is necessary for cUAM applications. In this article, we first introduce the communication requirements and spectrum management challenges in cUAM. Then we propose to apply deep reinforcement learning technology to perform dynamic spectrum management in cUAM. Next, a cUAM use case is investigated where a deep-reinforcement-learning-based dynamic spectrum sharing solution is proposed to minimize the total UAM mission completion time.

Meanwhile, the widely deployed Internet of drones (IoD) in smart cities has also brought up new concerns regarding performance, security, and privacy. The centralized framework adopted by conventional UAM networks is not adequate to handle high mobility and dynamicity. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure device authentication, data integrity, and privacy preservation in UAM networks. Thanks to its characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and unalterability, blockchain is recognized as a promising technology to enhance security and privacy for UAM networks. In this paper, we introduce LightMAN, a lightweight microchained fabric for data assurance and resilience-oriented UAM networks. LightMAN is tailored for small-scale permissioned UAV networks, in which a microchain acts as a lightweight distributed ledger for security guarantees. Thus, participants are enabled to authenticate drones and verify the genuineness of data that are sent to/from drones without relying on a third-party agency. In addition, a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage strategy is adopted that not only improves performance (e.g., latency and throughput) but also ensures privacy preservation for sensitive information in UAM networks. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and tested on a micro-air–vehicle link (MAVLink) simulator.

Regulation and definition of aerial networks, but also the characterization of ground facilities (vertiports) to allow passengers and freight to access the services are among the most relevant issues to be discussed. To identify UAM transportation networks, suitably connected with ground transportation services, digital twin models could be adopted to support the modelling and simulation of existing—and expected—scenarios with constantly updated data for identifying solutions addressing the design and management of transport systems. In this perspective, a digital twin model applied to an existing urban context—the city of Bologna, in northern Italy—is presented in combination with a novel air transport network that includes the third dimension.

In order to verify whether a communication network for a new non-terrestrial user service such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) satisfies the required performance, it is necessary to perform a simulation reflecting the characteristics of the corresponding terrain environments as accurately as possible. For this simulation, A2G channel models corresponding to various terrain environments and a method of automatically classifying the terrain type of the simulation area must be provided. Many A2G channel models based on actual measurement results exist, but the practical automatic topography classification method still needs to be developed. This paper proposes the first practical automatic topography classification method using a two-step neural network-based classifier utilizing various geographic feature data as input. Since there is no open topography dataset to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we built a new dataset for five topography classes that reflect the characteristics of Korea’s topography, which is also a contribution of our study. The simulation results using the new data set show that the proposed ML-based method could increase the selection accuracy compared to the technique for direct classification by humans or the existing cross-correlation-based classification method. Since the proposed method utilizes the DSM data, open to the public, it can easily reflect the different terrain characteristics of each country.

Fault-tolerant (FT) machine drives offer a promising approach to improve reliability using existing technology. An FT integrated modular motor drive (IMMD) design is proposed for a quadrotor UAM application, and its estimated reliability is studied using Markov chain analysis. Quantitative examples show that raising the repair rate for the motor drive modules significantly reduces the IMMD's catastrophic failure rate. However, the lower bound on its failure rate with high repair rates is determined by its single-point failure (SPF) rate (e.g., motor bearings), highlighting the importance of aggressively suppressing as many of the IMMD's SPFs as possible.

Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) and their variants have previously been studied and applied in real-world situations, but these problems require additional depot locations, and not all the vehicles can travel to all the locations. In UAM operations, additional depot locations may not be required, and all vehicles can travel to all locations, meaning that existing routing problems are not suitable for application to the management of UAMs. Therefore, we propose a new formulation for UAM vertiport-to-vertiport operation by introducing new constraints. In addition, we integrate dynamic scheduling with the flight mission by controlling cruise speed and waiting in each UAM at each vertiport location to generate an arrival and departure schedule for different vertiports that can avoid collisions and increase the number of vehicles. A computational experiment is conducted using an MILP model, and the results show that although our formulation satisfies the problem definition, the computation time increases exponentially with an increase in the problem size. A case study is conducted in the Seoul area involving five vertiports, with 10- and 15-vehicle scenarios studied.

Modern VTOL designs feature a variety of configurations involving rotors, lifting surfaces and bluff bodies. The resulting aerodynamics are highly impacted by the interactions between those components and their wakes. This has consequences on the aircraft performance and on the downstream wake. Studying the effects of those interactions through CFD can inform the development of cheaper numerical models. In this work, we focus on the interaction between rotors and bluff bodies based on the example of a generic quadcopter in forward flight. Using the Vortex Particle–Mesh method, a CFD method well-suited for wake studies, we analyze the influence of the rotor-airframe interaction on the loads and on the development of the aircraft near wake. Our results show that the presence of the airframe induces a change in average thrust of maximum 2.4% on the rear rotors. Correspondingly, the contribution of the rotors to the overall aircraft lift and drag changes by less than 2%, suggesting that the airframe can be ignored if one seeks a simple model of the rotor forces. On the other hand, the airframe experiences peak loads due to its proximity with the blades. Thus, the rotor-airframe interaction must be accounted for in the prediction of airframe loads. Finally, comparing simulations with and without the airframe, we find that the trailing wake vortices converge to circulations less than 0.2% different.

Various studies have focused on designing and optimizing the aerodynamic performance of wings and propellers. However, existing studies optimized the wing and propeller separately due to the numerical challenges in simulations and optimization. It is not clear to what extent high-fidelity coupled wing-propeller aerodynamic optimization can benefit the propeller aircraft design. As a first step to answer the above question, this study develops the capability to simultaneously optimize the wing shape and actuator parameters. We use a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics solver to simulate the wing aerodynamics, and the propeller is modeled as an actuator disk. We develop a smoothed actuator disk formulation that allows us to change the actuator's location and radius during the optimization, along with the wing shape. We use the discrete adjoint approach to compute the derivatives and couple them with a gradient-based optimization framework. The benefit of the above adjoint-based optimization framework is that it can use a large number of design variables to allow large design freedom for both wing and actuator. We perform 15 optimizations to evaluate how various actuator parameters impact the wing aerodynamic performance; both single and double actuator configurations are considered. We observe that the spanwise location and outer radius are the two most important actuator parameters, and using more actuator parameters as the design variables result in better performance. For example, optimizing the wing shape while allowing the actuator location and outer radius to move exhibits 11.4% more drag reduction compared with optimizing the wing shape while fixing the actuator parameters.

A series of analytical processes for vertiport design, demand prediction, and performance analysis is presented. To design the vertiport layout, we propose a novel algorithm that evaluates the surrounding obstacles by considering current regulations. The potential demand for air taxi services by urban air mobility (UAM) as multimodal transportation is predicted by a discrete choice model that estimates the probability of choosing an air taxi service given the time saving of UAM. Then, the sensitivity of demand was analyzed for the catchment area, travel cost, and the number of passengers on board. The sensitivity analysis showed that the demand for UAM was sensitive to all factors considered. Vertiport performance is evaluated by comparing the expected number of operations derived from the UAM demand to the vertiport capacity. The proposed methodology was applied to a vertiport in the Seoul metropolitan area for the initial UAM operations. The results show that having one less gate significantly increases the waiting time of the UAM when the utilization factor of the waiting queue is high. However, the average waiting time is less than 20 min (the maximum hover time of eVTOL vehicles) if the vertiport has a sufficient number of gates, depending on the traffic volume of UAM. Therefore, it is essential to determine the number of gates considering the expected traffic volume to ensure safe UAM operations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.","On-demand service; Urban air mobility; Vertiport capacity; Vertiport design; Vertiport performance"

A flow analysis was conducted via simulations based on actuator disk method. The parameters analyzed included the number of propellers, rotating direction, and propeller interval. An increment in the number of propellers increased the wing lift and drag, in addition to the propeller thrust and power. Although the lift-to-drag ratio decreased, the ratio of the wing lift to the propeller power increased. The lift and lift-to-drag ratio of the co-rotating systems were larger than those of the counter rotating systems; however, the lift-to-drag ratio of the latter exceeded that of the former when the number of propellers was seven. An increment in the required thrust increased the lift-to-drag ratio of the counter rotating system in comparison with that of the co-rotating system. Configuration with propellers concentrated at the wing tip increased the lift and drag. However, when the tip propeller was fixed at the wing tip, with the other propellers concentrated in the vicinity of the wing center, the lift increased more, while the drag decreased. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.","Actuator disk method; Aerodynamic performance; Distributed electric propulsion; Parametric study; Urban air mobility; Wing–propeller interaction"

Nikolsky Honorary Lecture and journal paper is to highlight the key flight control technology advances of the past 50 years and demonstrate how these advances are being applied and extended to the new family of rotorcraft: modern high-speed military rotorcraft, eVTOL urban air mobility, and advanced air mobility aircraft. The first part of this journal paper reviews flight control technologies drivers that are unique to rotorcraft and highlights key advances of the past 50 years in the areas of handling-qualities requirements (ADS-33), physics-based models, system identification, and flight control. A central theme is the shift from time-domain to frequency-domain based characterization of the closed-loop response and design methods for rotorcraft that have become increasingly dependent on sophisticated feedback control systems to achieve closed-loop stability, disturbance rejection, and most importantly closed-loop handling-qualities response for all-weather operations. Frequency-domain analysis, design, and test methods of the past 50 years are highlighted relating key advances in each discipline and two integrated example success stories. In the second part of this paper, we consider the key challenges, advancements, and needed future research for four new classes of rotorcraft: the military future vertical lift family of high-speed rotorcraft, unmanned autonomous systems/urban air mobility based on fielded conventional helicopters, small electric VTOL unmanned aerial vehicle rotorcraft, and larger eVTOL urban air mobility rotorcraft. The next sections look across the challenges and solution spaces that are common to these four new classes of rotorcraft as a blueprint for needed research advances.

Hybrid electric propulsive systems potentially offer performance improvements during transient maneuvers, as well as sustaining the engine during flight phases characterized by high power demands. Among the challenges of hybridization in rotorcraft, there is the necessity to predict the dynamic behavior and its effect on the control of rotor shaft speed. In the present study, the dynamic behavior of a parallel hybrid electric propulsive system for a coaxial-rotor air taxi is analyzed in response to a typical sequence of pilot commands that encompasses the range of operations from hover to forward flight. The system is modeled with a dynamic approach and includes sub-models for the coaxial rotors, the turboshaft engine, the electric machine, and the battery. The results of the investigation show a better performance during transients of the hybrid system than a conventional turboshaft configuration, especially if the electric contribution to the power request is coordinated to account for the lag due to slower engine dynamic response. © 2022 by the authors.","hybrid electric propulsion systems; rotorcraft; urban air mobility"

The electrical machine with air cooling is preferred for eVTOL due to its simplicity and light weight. This paper presents a new air-cooling system for an electrical machine in an electric ducted fan propulsion system. The novel cooling system consists of a cooling guide vane with a heat pipe (CGVHP), which is located downstream of the ducted fan rotating blade. The heated end of the heat pipe is inserted into the stator end windings and the cold end is inserted into the cooling guide vane. The heat generated in the windings is transmitted to the cooling guide vane by the heat pipe and dissipated by the forced convection using low-temperature air passing through the ducted fan. The cooling performance of the cooling guide vane with the heat pipe was numerically simulated, considering several critical design factors.

We propose a simulation framework that facilitates analyzing the potential demand of UAM. We define five scenarios (ranging from representations of a niche application to a mass transport option) by varying the fleet size, available technologies, infrastructure placement, and pricing strategies. These scenarios are fed into an extended version of the agent-based transport simulation platform MATSim chained with the microscopic transportation orchestrator. The simulation results show that the system configuration has a big impact on UAM demand. The infrastructure capacity and fleet size were identified as the main bottlenecks. We see high levels of demand during peak hours and for trips up to 20 km; however, none of the scenarios result in a sufficiently high modal share of UAM that substantially reduces traffic volumes of ground-based modes, and hence have no significant impact on congestion. Yet, the different trip purposes generate significantly different demands. UAM for airport access could be an especially relevant modal choice in the premium airport-passenger segment. When aiming for an effective and sustainable UAM service, our recommendations are as follows: first, use it to support and improve, rather than cannibalize, existing public transport options; and second, minimize negative impacts on the environment and society to maximize public acceptance. © 2022 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",

The individual vehicle dynamics are aggregated to describe the overall flow feature in this macroscopic model. Firstly, UAM operations are modeled as flows and structured in a three-dimensional two-way air transport network. Then, a complexity optimal air traffic assignment in urban airspace is formulated as an optimization problem. Based upon the Linear Dynamical System (LDS), a novel complexity metric is defined as objective function, which takes into account dynamic flow structure, congestion, and operational efficiency. A two-phase approach combining Simulated Annealing (SA) and Dafermos’ Algorithm (DA) is introduced to efficiently solve this problem. To validate the proposed model, a case study of an air transport network in Singapore's urban airspace with two different demands is conducted. Comparative studies are carried out between the proposed algorithm and other widely used traffic assignment algorithms. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of assigning flows in an efficient and effective manner, reducing the complexity of the air transport network significantly. The results also show that optimizing the flow pattern reduces total complexity by 90.44%±0.53% and 92.12%±0.35% with 95% confidence interval, respectively in two scenarios.

As a result, the integration of formal verification-based methods to assure the correctness of the interactions between multiple distributed robots has become ever more important. However, going from formally verified models designed in formal environments/software such as UPPAAL to robotic simulation software such as robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Nonetheless, such a translation from formal to simulation environment is essential for robotic applications that are going to be deployed in the real world, for obvious economical and safety reasons. In this article, we provide our insights into the development of a framework that integrates design and formal verification at a higher level of abstraction and then performing a translation to ROS, focusing on a scenario for distributed drones representing urban air mobility. Through this article, we seek to accelerate the development cycle in transitioning from formally verified systems to simulation. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Distributed protocols; formal modeling; robot operating system (ROS) simulation; UPPAAL"

Traditionally a layered approach to collision avoidance has been employed using a centralized air traffic control system, established rules of the road, separation assurance, and last minute pairwise collision avoidance. With the advent of Urban Air Mobility (air taxis), the expected increase in traffic density in urban environments, short time scales, and small distances between aircraft favor decentralized decision making on-board the aircraft. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based method, named FastMDP, which can solve a certain subclass of MDPs quickly, and demonstrate using the algorithm online to safely maintain separation and avoid collisions with multiple aircraft (1-on-n) while remaining computationally efficient. We compare the FastMDP algorithm’s performance against two online collision avoidance algorithms that have been shown to be both efficient and scale to large numbers of aircraft: Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our simulation results show that under the assumption that aircraft do not have perfect knowledge of other aircraft intent FastMDP outperforms ORCA and MCTS in collision avoidance behavior in terms of loss of separation and near mid-air collisions while being more computationally efficient. We further show that in our simulation FastMDP behaves nearly as well as MCTS with perfect knowledge of other aircraft intent. Our results show that FastMDP is a promising algorithm for collision avoidance that is also computationally efficient. © 2022 IEEE.","Collision avoidance, Markov decision process"

This paper evaluates the performance and practical challenges associated with fabricating and flight testing an unmanned aircraft powered by a turboelectric system based on a 7 kW turbine engine. Emerging hybrid gas-electric aircraft concepts have been the subject of numerous design studies and analytical evaluations; however, there is a critical need to identify and assess practical issues associated with integrating a hybrid turboelectric power system into an aircraft.

Visual sensors have the potential of providing accurate measurements with reduced budgets, although integrity issues, as well as performance degradation in low visibility and highly dynamic environments, may pose challenges. In this context, this paper focuses on autonomous navigation during vertical approach and landing procedures and provides three main contributions. First, visual sensing requirements relevant to Urban Air Mobility scenarios are defined considering realistic landing trajectories, landing pad dimensions, and wind effects. Second, a multi-sensor-based navigation architecture based on an Extended Kalman Filter is presented which integrates visual estimates with inertial and GNSS measurements and includes different operating modes and ad hoc integrity checks. The presented processing pipeline is built to provide the required navigation performance in different conditions including day/night flight, atmospheric disturbances, low visibility, and can support the autonomous initialization of a missed approach procedure. Third, performance assessment of the proposed architecture is conducted within a highly realistic simulation environment which reproduces real world scenarios and includes variable weather and illumination conditions. Results show that the proposed architecture is robust with respect to dynamic and environmental challenges, providing cm-level positioning uncertainty in the final landing phase. Furthermore, autonomous initialization of a Missed Approach Procedure is demonstrated in case of loss of visual contact with the landing pad and consequent increase of the self-estimated navigation uncertainty. © 2022 by the authors.","autonomous approach and landing; multi-sensor-based navigation; Urban Air Mobility; Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft; visual landing pad; visual sensing requirements"

Early discussions on this have been technology-focused, pointing at the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for cargo delivery and electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft for passenger transportation. Recently, the term ‘Urban Air Mobility’ has become widely used to encompass these vehicles within a new mobility ecosystem. However, due to deficiencies in this term, other proposals – namely ‘Advanced Air Mobility’, ‘New Air Mobility and ‘Innovative Air Mobility’ – have emerged. The rise in different terms can lead to confusion as their scope is not always fully known or appreciated, and they are often used interchangeably. This paper, therefore, shifts focus from the recent debate about the definition of ‘UAS’ to the aforementioned ecosystem terms so to address and evaluate them as potentially different aspects of the same concept. An interpretive approach of the terms, an assessment of their major characteristics, as well as an analysis of their relationship with the aircraft types will take place.

To address the concern of flight fairness between different eVTOLs in the free flight airspace, the strategy of permit assignment is introduced. By incorporating the risk domain formulation into the sampling-based path planning with the strategy of permit assignment, the algorithm proposed in this paper not only inherits the computational advantage of the sampling-based methods, but also guarantees a stochastically feasible flying zone at every time step.

This study explores the economic feasibility of the UAM airport shuttle service from two perspectives. First, this study estimates the fare of UAM services to attract customers. The UAM service should maintain a competitive price to convert existing transportation users into UAM users. This study used Incheon Airport (ICN) ground transportation data to estimate a competitive fare based on the multinomial logit model. The pricing range at which UAM services can obtain users from Seoul Station to ICN is estimated to be 96 to 108 USD, assuming the new service reduces traveling time by 30–40 min compared to taxi service. The comparison with professional institutions indicates that the 96–108 USD price range is feasible. However, according to a simulation based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, other approaches to increase economic feasibility are required. Second, this study reviewed operational policies to improve the economic feasibility of UAM shuttle services from two perspectives. The first is a service perspective that introduces new services or enhances the current service level. The internalization of CNS (communications, navigation, and surveillance) and UTM (unmanned traffic management) services can be a new business area, including premium routing. The second is introducing a dynamic pricing policy. Segmented pricing, time-based pricing, and changing market conditions strategies can practically strengthen the economic feasibility. Operating an airport Vertiport providing a dedicated path for UAM passengers can allow UAM operators to charge more on a premium passenger segment by shortening airport procedure time. Because it can avoid the uncertainty of road congestion, there is plenty of incentive to set higher fares during peak times with severe congestion. In addition, by creating a market environment in which multiple operators participate, the operators can share the burden of infrastructure construction and operation, which account for more than 80% of the total operating costs, increasing the economic feasibility of services. © 2022","Airport shuttle; Airport vertiport; Dynamic pricing policy; Economic feasibility; Multinomial logit model; Urban air mobility"

This study aims to estimate the parameters of the mode choice model incorporating the cleaner transportation mode and evaluate the environmental impact by calculating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ground traffic. A stated preference survey is employed to estimate the parameters for each travel mode, including the emerging travel mode. The awareness and experience of the air travel modes remove the hesitation concerning travel mode choice having positive values, but concerns about taking new types of air mobility reduce the probability of choosing urban air mobility. The macroscopic travel demand forecasting program simulates the travel demand of urban air mobility to calculate the reduction of CO2 emissions between before and after the introduction. While about 30 thousand of urban air mobility travel demand are generated after the introduction of urban air mobility in the urban area, it reduces about 90 thousand tons of CO2 emissions from the ground traffic. The introduction of urban air mobility causes modal shifts from ground traffic, reducing climate change and global warming.

The integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) provides globally uniform coordinate information, and the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) gives stable and accurate local pose estimates. However, the error of the integrated INS/GNSS increases rapidly in GNSS-challenged environments, and the VIO system suffers from the long-term error accumulation. To cope with these difficulties, this paper proposes a new tightly coupled Visual-Inertial-GNSS (VIG) system to achieve robust and drift-free pose estimation utilising GNSS raw measurements, image features, and inertial measurements. A novel compressed state constraint Kalman Filter (CSCKF) is formulated to combine time-propagated feature measurements and differential GNSS observations to aid INS. Compared to the conventional integrated navigation systems, the proposed CSCKF-based VIG system is advantageous in maintaining the minimum number of states without unnecessary state augmentation and no loss of performance. The proposed system is evaluated by field experiments in different GNSS availability situations.

UAM vehicles can navigate themselves using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) tightly coupled systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to IMU failures aside from GNSS faults, given that UAM vehicles will use low-cost IMUs. IMU faults can severely degrade navigation integrity, thereby threatening UAM operational safety and increasing the difficulty of urban air traffic management. This issue can be mitigated by employing redundant IMUs. Civil aircraft use consistency checks among multiple high-performance Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) to enhance navigation integrity. But this approach is not suitable for low-cost IMUs because of fast error accumulation. In response, this work proposes a new approach to enhance navigation integrity for UAM by integrating multiple IMUs with GNSS. In this approach, multiple IMUs and GNSS are tightly coupled by a centralized Kalman filter, and the corresponding integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to (a) detect the faults in GNSS and/or IMUs and (b) evaluate the probabilistic upper bounds on navigation errors, namely protection levels. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method and to present sensitivity analyses, and the results suggest the effectiveness of the new approach.

Although UAM offers many benefits (e.g., cost reduction and increase in transportation capacity), many challenges need to be faced to enable safe and efficient operations. Furthermore, trajectory planning is challenging in the National Airspace System (NAS) and UAM operations due to several factors. Finally, new initiatives concerning UAM trajectory planning can be accelerated with the support of an automatic what-if platform capable of evaluating trajectories feasibility and efficiency.

TUS enables users to test new UAM algorithms (e.g., flow management strategies, real-time evaluation of maneuvers effectiveness, airspace configurations) and simulate both manned and unmanned vehicles. Furthermore, TUS operation relies on a set of inputs and evaluates the trajectories generated from efficiency and safety perspectives.

These particular aircraft come with different designs and are very different from traditional aircraft. An effective weight reduction method is required to enable ongoing design validation and verification. This paper presents the design of an aircraft with a high space utilization rate of the take-off and landing stage, which allows vertical take-off and landing and has long battery life. For the components fixed at the wing tips and used for installing ducted fans and based on the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, this paper puts forward two methods to carry out the lightweight design according to the stress conditions of the aircraft, namely, the manual setting the internal structure and the topology optimization.

Herein, we propose using particle swarm and hybrid optimisation algorithms instead of evolutionary algorithms in this work. The goal of speeding the route planning process and reducing computational costs is achieved using particle swarm and direct search algorithms.

Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission has been adapted in NOMA systems to improve the performance of a cell edge user. Conventional CoMP combines received signals from multiple sources using maximum ratio combining (MRC) in order to improve the user's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While MRC provides the highest diversity gain of any diversity combining technology, it requires latency for co-phasing and combining the received signals. Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has emerged as a viable option for future mobility in metropolitan areas in order to avoid terrestrial traffic congestion. However, a flight control information of a UAM, especially an unmanned UAM is very sensitive to latency. Hence MRC is not recommendable for UAM due to the inherent latency. We consider selection combining (SC) which has less latency rather than MRC as a combining technology in CoMP. This study derives the outage performance of UAM with selective CoMP in closed-form. The analytical results are compared and verified with that of the Monte Carlo simulation. The outage performances of a UAM in NOMA-NOMA and NOMA-OMA modes are compared. It is shown that the NOMA-OMA mode has better performance than the NOMA-NOMA mode irrespective of the given conditions, and has over 3 dB SNR gains under the given conditions. When the performance of UAM in the NOMA-NOMA mode is not satisfying, it is recommended to switch to the NOMA-OMA mode based on this study. © 2022.

Thereby, not only different UAM aircraft architectures, but also fleet combinations, technology scenarios, and operational strategies are studied and evaluated for different success criteria. The UAM fleets are simulated for 24-hour operations, considering non-uniform passenger demand, dispatch of passenger as well as deadhead flights, aircraft architectural performance, load factor, energy consumption, and turnaround procedures. A large design of experiments, consisting of approximately 5,000 design points, is executed. Eventually, this article demonstrates the proof of concept for the proposed SoS framework and provides several parameter sensitivities for a given UAM scenario. For such complex SoS, analytical methods would not suffice for understanding complex and often nonlinear interactions.

Lifting the transportation offer into the third dimension by introducing Urban Air Mobility (UAM) may be a promising step towards an improvement. But what characteristics does UAM need to offer in order to represent successfully an extension to our traditional (public) transportation system and to fit into the concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) where various modes of transportation are bundled and accessible on demand? On the one hand, the supporting ground infrastructure specialized in accommodating UAM and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations, in this research named vertidrome, and on the other hand a consortium of stakeholders (vehicle operator, vertidrome operator, air traffic management, passenger, city councils, etc.) will determine a considerable portion of these requirements. The vertidrome is a UAM traffic junction, which merges airside and landside operations and interactions between the vertidrome infrastructure components, the vehicles and the passengers. This research work focuses on the exemplary development of a vertidromes airside operation considering a UAM application at the Munich trade fair (Germany). Following this objective, we analyze the unique characteristics of UAM, review the current state of the art regarding UAM ground infrastructure designs and introduce a new and VTOL-specific terminology vertidrome.

These fan stages provide a tonal noise advantage as the blade passing frequency tone is cut-off. Contrary to conventional cut-off designs, low-count OGV (Outlet Guide Vane) designs are fan stages with fewer stator vanes than rotor blades. Low-count OGV designs benefit from lower broadband noise due to the reduced number of stator vanes. However, the blade passing frequency tone may no longer be cut-off. Therefore, we assess tonal noise reduction mechanisms for subsonic low-count OGV fan stages. We use an analytical and a numerical method to predict the rotor–stator interaction noise for different blade count pairings. The results indicate that the mode phase propagation angle and the cut-on factor are two acoustic parameters that dominantly influence the noise excitation. For certain blade count pairings an acoustic benefit exists if the mode phase propagation angle is congruent to the stator leading edge angle and / or if the mode is away from the cut-off limit. Moreover, reducing the rotor tip speed allows, for some configurations, a cut-off design even with fewer stator vanes than rotor blades (inverse cut-off).

Focusing on the simulation of the effects due to the spanwise distribution of blade twist and chord length, two surrogate modelling techniques are examined: one based on Artificial Neural Networks and one based on Genetic Programming. The numerical database for the identification of these models is determined by the combined application of a boundary integral formulation suitable for the potential aerodynamics solution around lifting/thrusting bodies, and the Farassat 1A formulation for the evaluation of the noise field.

UAMs are based on eco-friendly electric propulsive systems to enhance mobility and maximize the use of three-dimensional airspace. However, UAM aircraft are very vulnerable to lightning strikes due to their relatively small size and flight characteristics, flying close to the ground. To tackle this problem, the present study developed a lightning zoning method for UAM aircraft with complex configurations and investigated the direct effects of lightning strikes on the prop-rotor blade of a UAM aircraft. First, computational simulation models for zoning analysis were developed for four representative UAM aircraft (one wingless multi-copter, one winged lift/cruise, and two winged vectored thrust types). The lightning zoning analysis identified the prop-rotor blade tips as Zone 1A, which has a high probability of initial lightning attachment. The direct effects of lightning strikes on a prop-rotor blade made of woven carbon/epoxy laminate were then investigated using both experimental and numerical methods. In general, the damage pattern of the simulation results agreed fairly well with the damage pattern in the experimental results. Moreover, it was shown that the prop-rotor blade of a relatively small UAM aircraft can suffer more damage, even after being struck by the lightning of the same intensity. In the future, since batteries, electric motors, inverters, and hydrogen fuel tanks, which are required by the new propulsion systems in UAM aircraft, will be increasingly used, designing a lightning protection system that properly reflects these changes will emerge as an important issue. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Lightning direct effects; Lightning test; Lightning zoning; Multi-physics simulation; Prop-rotor blade; Urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft"

A quasi-steady aerodynamic formulation is used to derive the aerodynamic loads on all lifting surfaces. In addition to the conventional control surfaces of the fixed-wing aircraft, the tiltrotor angular positions and rotational speeds are also considered additional control inputs in the derivation of nonlinear flight dynamic equations. These nonlinear equations are then linearized with respect to a set of trimmed conditions to generate the corresponding linear time-invariant state-space models, which are best suited for flight control design.

First, the influence of the finest wake-grid spacing (∆finest) on the side-by-side rotor acoustics is studied. No significant difference in overall sound pressure level (OASPL) is found between the two wake-grid spacing cases: ∆finest = 5% Ctip and 10% Ctip. Physical noise sources, such as impulsive self blade–vortex interactions, rotor-to-rotor blade–vortex interactions, and separated flow and blade interactions, are investigated in details based on high-fidelity CFD simulation results and noise-integrand analyses. The effect of rotor overlap on rotor acoustics is also assessed. It is found that the maximum OASPL difference among the overlap cases is about 1 dB, but the radiation patterns are different for each overlap case. Furthermore, the noise of the side-by-side rotor with 0% and 25% overlaps is compared against the noise of a conventional helicopter and various background noises. The side-by-side rotor noise is comparable with the helicopter noise around 1000 Hz.

For this purpose, an existing vertiport model consisting of pads, gates and stands was refined through two means. First, a sensitivity study with over 100 simulations was executed shedding light on the driving processes on a vertiport airfield. Second, an expert interview series with 17 participants was conducted, letting the experts evaluate the model and specify relevant parameter values. Three main results should find mention here: (1) Pad operations were identified to be most impactful on passenger delays.

Typically, strategic UTM involves solving an optimization problem that ensures that proposed flight schedules do not exceed airspace and vertiport capacities. However, the dynamic nature and low lead-time of applications such as on-demand delivery and urban air mobility traffic may reduce the efficiency and fairness of strategic UTM. We first discuss the adaptation of three fairness metrics into a traffic flow management problem (TFMP). Then, with computational simulations of a drone package delivery scenario in Toulouse, we evaluate trade-offs in the TFMP between efficiency and fairness, as well as between different fairness metrics. We show that system fairness can be improved with little loss in efficiency. We also consider two approaches to the integrated scheduling of both high lead-time flights (i.e., flights with a schedule known in advance) and low lead-time flights in a rolling horizon optimization framework. We compare the performance of both approaches for different horizon lengths and under varying proportions of high and low lead-time flights. © 2021, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.","Air traffic flow management; Efficiency; Equity; Fairness; UAS traffic management"

Such a scenario introduces specific criticalities for healthcare organizations in densely populated areas and below congested airspace, such as the Milan metropolitan area. The authors applied a co-creation methodology to design a highly automated drone service for the delivery of pharmaceuticals at San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. The needs of the main users were identified by means of semi-structured interviews and visualization material. Based on those outcomes, a drone service was designed and validated with the main users. It emerged that the main gain point of such a service would be increasing hospital logistics efficiency. The risks tied to the operations (e.g., tampering of the delivery container) were evaluated and appropriate mitigations were identified (e.g., use of tamper-evident seals or mechatronic locks). The information required by the digital system offering the needed logistics functions was analyzed for future development.

Flying cars such as urban air mobility vehicles, passenger drones, and electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts have the potential to relieve seriously congested ground traffic in cities via direct point-to-point air movements. To date, conventional research in which the airframe of a flying car is optimized for use in medical emergencies has not identified a sustainable solution. The purpose of this study is to verify the technical applicability of a flying car for use in medical emergencies. The weighted sum method is used to optimize the design of multi-rotor, vectored-thrust (tilt-rotor), and lift + cruise types of flying cars. A simulation scenario that considers cruising speed and flight height is conducted based on an analysis of stakeholder interviews with a pilot, an inflight doctor, and an operating company. To optimize the parameters of a flying car airframe, four objective functions, namely the energy required for a round trip, noise value from rotors, downwash speed from rotors, and landing area size, are chosen because the results of a requirement analysis revealed that they were significant for the sustainability of the flying car system. The results of the simulation reveal that the required battery energy densities for all three types exceed the current lithium-ion battery capacities. Therefore, an upgrade in battery capacity is critical for the realization of a flying car. Although the noise level is found to be less than that of a conventional helicopter, it is necessary to develop a rotor to decrease noise levels for environmental reasons. Finally, both the downwash speed and landing area of a flying car are estimated to be less than those of a conventional helicopter, making it possible for the flying car to land in tight spaces. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.","EVTOL; Flying car; Medical emergency; Sustainability; System design"

However, these innovations sometimes raise concerns, notably in terms of societal, safety, and environmental impacts. This is the case for services related to the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are emerging rapidly. Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, date back to the first third of the twentieth century in aviation industry, when they were mostly used for military purposes. Nowadays, drones of various types and sizes are used for many purposes, such as precision agriculture, search and rescue missions, aerial photography, shipping and delivery, etc. Starting to operate in areas with low population density, drones are now looking for business in urban and suburban areas, in what is called urban air mobility (UAM). However, this rapid growth of the drone industry creates psychological fear of the unknown in some parts of society. Reducing this fear will play an important role in public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. This paper presents the main concerns of society with regard to drone operations, as already captured in some public surveys, and proposes a list of mitigation measures to reduce these concerns. The proposed list is then analyzed, and its applicability to individual, urban, very large demonstration flights is explained, using the feedback from the CORUS-XUAM project.

One of the necessary elements for air taxi-based transportation service system is a skyport, which is a designated area for take-off and landing of air taxis. In planning a skyport network for air taxi transportation system, it is important to consider midair congestion between air taxis. Severe congestion increases the risk of collisions, which in turn increases the complexity in scheduling and routing in the subsequent operations phase. In this study, we propose a novel hub location problem (HLP) that incorporates traffic congestion caused by intersecting vehicles along hub-to-hub arcs. Modeling congestion in an HLP formulation involves nonconvex bilinear terms, which makes it difficult to solve. We tackle this challenge by exploiting a property of an optimal solution and reformulating the original model to obtain a linear formulation. We also develop a heuristic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm to handle large-size problems for practical applications. Using the proposed model and solution methods, extensive experiments have been conducted to study optimal design of air taxi network under various environments.

A total of three CFD models are simulated: a one-passenger isolated rotor configuration, a one-passenger full configuration with a fuselage, and a six-passenger isolated rotor configuration. The noise comparison between the one-passenger isolated rotor case and the full configuration case shows that the vehicle fuselage increases the A-weighted sound pressure level (SPL) up to 5 dB. The acoustic comparison between the one-passenger and the six-passenger isolated rotor configuration shows that the maximum overall SPL difference is up to 14 dB. Furthermore, it is shown that the noise of the six-passenger configuration is approximately 11 dB lower than that of a similar-sized conventional helicopter in an overhead scenario. The community noise impact of UAM aircraft is also assessed and compared to various background noise levels.

The perspective of eVTOLs going into service in the coming years for the transport of passengers raises new safety concerns. Indeed, it is necessary to ensure the reliability and safety aspects of those aircraft systems that will be flying under new operational missions, differing from current fixed wing (airplanes) and rotorcraft (helicopters) aircraft. At the same time, the evolution of aircraft systems monitoring technology is making it possible to acquire increasing amounts of data. The high complexity of new systems, combined with the huge amount of data provided, can make the decision-making process more difficult for pilots. Machine learning makes it possible to evaluate this data and improve reliability and safety. Even as the number of aeronautical accidents has decreased over the last years, 60–80% of those accidents are the result of human failure. In the initial implementation and operation stages of eVTOLs, machine learning (ML) can support pilots by using aircraft data to predict system failures and contribute to improve reliability and safety. Then, at an advanced stage of eVTOL operation, ML may help reduce human interaction with the aircraft, paving the way toward fully autonomous aircraft. The association of ML with technologies such as Digital Twins and 6G networks has the potential to enable safe and reliable autonomous flight. However, the introduction of eVTOLs will also increase air traffic in highly populated areas and thus needs to be studied to support the incorporation of the future autonomous aircraft.

This study demonstrates a numerical prediction of the rolling tire noises considering tread composite material models in the coupled acoustic-structural finite element analysis. The viscoelastic master curves were developed for the frequency-dependent damping in the structural vibrations of the tire. It was numerically found that the tread composites with 230.4% and 1,428% larger storage (E’) and loss moduli (E”), respectively, resulted in 1.16–9.79% louder structure-borne noises. Moreover, the elastic modulus (E) of the tread composites was proportionally related to the tire noises, suggesting that reduced elastic and viscoelastic moduli are desired for low-noise tires. This study can contribute to thoroughly understanding how the composite material properties, particularly viscoelasticity, can be designed to control structural noise and vibration in next-generation structures such as autonomous electric vehicles and urban air mobility. © 2022 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acoustics; finite elements; tire noise; tread composite; vibrations; viscoelastic material"

Ignoring the existence of intra-respondent preference heterogeneity could bias preference elicitation and demand forecast. Thus far, most studies covering inter- and intra-respondent preference heterogeneity have applied the mixed multinomial logit model. Meanwhile, the behavioural explanations for such preference variations remain under-explored. This paper accommodates inter- and intra-respondent preference heterogeneity through a two-layer latent class modelling structure, where the continuous random distributions are replaced with discrete mixtures in both layers. A latent variable representing variety-seeking is included to explain class membership probabilities, offering additional behavioural insights concerning the source of preference heterogeneity both across and within respondents. Two aspects associated with variety-seeking are examined: novelty-seeking (i.e. the inclination to adopt new modes) and alternation (i.e. the tendency to vary one’s behaviour regularly by selecting different modes continuously). In the context of new shared mobility, this paper finds the role of both aspects in preference heterogeneity. Specifically, novelty seekers are found to be more likely to fall into the class with higher probabilities of switching from existing modes to the new air taxi service than novelty avoiders, and alternation seekers are more likely to belong to the class with higher probabilities to exhibit intra-respondent preference heterogeneity than alternation avoiders. This paper, therefore, provides empirical evidence to identify the target customers of the new air taxi service. © 2022, The Author(s).","Inter- and intra-respondent preference heterogeneity; Latent class model; Latent variable; Urban air mobility; Variety-seeking; Vertical take-off and landing"

This paper demonstrates the use of human-centric flight guidance concepts to mitigate the effects of non-catastrophic failures in future VTOL UAM aircraft. Specifically, a single failure in the lateral steering function of an automatic flight control system is considered. A new waypoint guidance law is proposed to generate the required roll command to manually steer the aircraft toward a predefined safe landing zone. Two display concepts are proposed to aid the manual execution of the roll steering command: a head-down display (HDD), and a head-mounted display (HMD). The guidance law and the display concepts were integrated into a high-fidelity, wide field-of-view rotorcraft simulation environment. Human-in-the-loop experiments were performed with non-pilot test subjects. The effectiveness of the guidance law and display concepts along with the associated piloting performance and human factor impacts were assessed. The results indicated that all test subjects were able to reach a close vicinity of the final waypoint. The HMD induced lower workload whereas the HDD resulted in better tracking performance.

Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background: The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method: A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results: Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board.

This has led to efforts that aim to model the interactional aerodynamics of rotors operating in close proximity and its impact on performance. While computational fluid dynamics can accurately characterize the physics of multirotor interaction, in most cases it is too computationally demanding for performing studies over a range of parameters. On the other hand, lower-fidelity models approximate the underlying physics and are computationally inexpensive, but are often imprecise in predicting the fields of interest. In this study, we present a multifidelity approach that inherits the accuracy of a high-fidelity method, while retaining the computational efficiency of a low-fidelity model. With this approach, the low-fidelity model is used to span the entire space of parameters and identify key parameter values to perform high-fidelity simulations. A few selected high-fidelity simulations performed at these parameter values are then used in a lifting procedure to determine multifidelity solutions at other parameter values. In this paper we apply this strategy to determine the lift and drag distributions of a two-rotor assembly as a function of the longitudinal and vertical distance between them.

Numerical models are used to compute the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of these configurations. Further dissection of the various CROR noise sources is then carried out in order to better understand their contribution to CROR noise, and to direct the design of future low-noise CRORs. Noise reductions were observed when the rotor–rotor spacing was increased. Increased contraction of the wake requires the need for increased clipping to reduce the tip vortex interaction source. Noise reductions were also observed in the case of asynchronous rotational speeds. However, this was accompanied by a reduction in propulsive efficiency.

This layer aims to enable stochastic control of traffic behaviour using a single parameter, which is achieved by applying distributed stochastic task allocation. The task allocation algorithm is used to allocate speeds to vehicles in a scalable way. By regulating the speed distribution of vehicles the conflict rates remain manageable.

Using transient simulations the dynamic performance of the system is analysed. It is shown that the traffic conflict reduction problem can be transformed into a control design problem.

In recent days, the deployment of urban air mobility (UAM) has been actively discussed for a new aerial transport service in an urban area. Since UAM conveys passengers, both the traffic and the control information for passengers and a vehicle are important. Therefore, this paper considers a NOMA-based aerial cellular network with a UAM as an aerial user and a ground user as a terrestrial user.

Further, the condition to maintain the balance between the forward and the reverse links for the identical quality of service (QoS) is derived. Numerical results show that the outage probability of the forward link decreases with the increase of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, we noticed that the outage probability of the reverse link shows the error floor, which does not decrease with the received SNR and remains constant, caused by the interference from the ground user (GU).

In a UAM eVTOL rotorcraft, the smaller vortices generated from multiple propulsors interact with lifting surfaces such as wings, fuselage, and propellers in a complex manner. Therefore, to accurately predict the performance and noise of UAM eVTOL rotorcraft, vortices should be preserved with little dissipation; and their interactions must be modeled precisely. These requirements need a numerical algorithm with a refined resolution than that allowed by conventional schemes. This paper proposes a newly modified enhanced multidimensional limiting process (eMLP) for vorticity conservation (eMLP-VC), which improves the original eMLP by accounting for the fact that most rotorcraft flowfields are vortex dominated and subsonic. For advanced capability in preserving vortices, the distinguishing criterion was modified through vortex profile analysis, and low-Mach-number adjustment was performed by reconstructing the interpolated primitive variables.

These configurations feature electrical power systems and distributed propulsion architectures, both uncommon in current aircraft. As such, the design of eVTOL aircraft lies outside the bounds of current established frameworks and poses many challenges in the field of preliminary aircraft design. This paper presents a preliminary design methodology for open rotor eVTOL configurations with batteries as the power source. First, the propeller external dimensions are calculated, and then an optimised blade geometry for cruise condition is computed. Thereupon, the batteries and electric motors are sized. The design framework is then applied to an eVTOL aircraft with a design range of 400 km and a capacity of five occupants (four passengers and one pilot), focusing on the central-European market and aimed to be released in 2030. The final configuration is a battery-powered tandem-wing aircraft with 12 variable-pitch, variable-speed open rotors placed on the leading edges of the wings. These rotors rotate outboard-down and feature six blades. The power source comprises 24 solid-state lithium batteries with a nominal voltage of 500 V and an assumed energy density of 500 Wh/kg. The proposed design methodology offers the possibility of computing the necessary propeller geometry for numerical simulations in the early stages of the design, and of easily obtaining accurate estimates for the mass of the power system which can improve the overall mass estimates for the analysed configuration. © 2021 by the authors.

Preventing the conflict among urban aircraft is crucial to UAM traffic safety, which is a key in enabling large scale UAM operation. Pre-flight conflict-free path planning can provide a strategic layer in the maintenance of safety performance, thus becomes an important element in UAM. This paper aims at tackling conflict-free path planning problem for UAM operation with a consideration of four-dimensional airspace management. In the paper, we first introduce AirMatrix, previously developed by the team, and extend it as a four-dimensional airspace management concept. On the basis of AirMatrix, we formulate the shortest flight time path planning problem considering resolution of conflicts with both static and dynamic obstacles. A Conflict-Free A* (CFA*) algorithm is developed for planning four-dimensional paths based on first-come-first-served scheme.

The design of hybrid-electric propulsion systems (HEPSs) for rotorcraft is seen as being able to contribute to those goals. This work aims to conduct a comprehensive design and tradeoff analysis of hybrid powerplants for rotorcraft, targeting enhanced payload-range capability and fuel economy. An integrated methodology for the design, performance assessment, and optimal implementation of HEPSs for conceptual rotorcraft has been developed. A multidisciplinary approach is devised comprising models for rotor aerodynamics, flight dynamics, HEPS performance, and weight estimation. All models are validated using experimental or flight test data. The methodology is deployed for the assessment of a hybrid-electric tilt-rotor, modeled after the NASA XV-15. This work targets to provide new insight into the preliminary design and sizing of optimally designed HEPSs for novel tilt-rotor aircraft. The paper demonstrates that at present, current battery energy densities (250 Wh/kg) severely limit the degree of hybridization if a fixed useful payload and range are to be achieved. However, it is also shown that if advancements in battery energy density to 500 Wh/kg are realized, a significant increase in the level of hybridization and hence reduction of fuel burned and carbon output relative to the conventional configuration can be attained.

These air taxis, also called e-VTOL, are conceived to exploit vertical take-off and landing capabilities, to carry people from one point to another, typically within the same city. In this paper, a new conceptual design methodology for urban air vehicles is presented and applied to an innovative convertiplane, called TiltOne, based on a box-wing architecture coupled with tilt-wing mechanisms. Several TiltOne configurations have been designed according to the current regulations imposed by European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and sensitivity analyses have been carried out on the varying main design parameters, such as wing loading and propellers’ disk loading, as well as main top-level aircraft requirements. The results provide an overview for today’s operational capabilities of such aircraft and, in addition, depict possible scenarios for a near-future horizon, based on the assumption of increased performance levels for the electric powertrain components. In such scenario, two different concepts of operations are analysed and discussed: the first is based on a given design range, long enough to cover the urban distances; the second is conceived to exploit the capability of flying multiple shorter missions with a single battery charge.

This study calculates a measure of air taxi demand for commuters for the 40 most populous combined statistical areas (CSAs) in the U.S. by using: (1) cell phone data to identify regular commuters in cities, (2) census data to associate household income characteristics with commuters, and (3) a mode choice model calibrated from a stated preference survey to predict the number of commuters that would use an air taxi.

Results are sensitive to location of existing vertiports, existing ground infrastructure and congestion levels on competing modes, and current commute patterns. A resultant set of online maps of potential air taxi routes allows readers to visualize how air taxi commuter routes differ across CSAs.

Long flight times in the terminal area pose a risk of exhaustion and great safety challenges. Given the terminal area of the multi-vertiport system (MVS-TA), this paper investigates the adaptive control system (ACS), which includes the design of the operating environment and the integrated scheduling model. The design of the operating environment is the basis of adaptive management, which consists of the concept of multi-ring structure and the junction control rules based on backpressure policy. Considering the power constraint and dynamic priority, an integrated model including path planning model and distributed sequencing model is constructed to solve the cooperative scheduling problem of approach-departure flights. Results from numerical analyses reveal that: First, in the case of large flight flow, ACS can achieve the efficiency and safety of MVS-TA operation better than the traditional control system. Secondly, the flight density into the terminal area has a greater impact on ACS performance relative to flight volume. With a density of less than 120 flights/hour, the operating efficiency of MVS-TA under ACS varies within 10.3% with the number of flights or density. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive control system; eVTOL; Multi-vertiport system; Operational structure; Scheduling model; Urban air mobility"

In particular, there is a need to develop a roadmap for the early implementation of passenger air mobility, aiming to identify the most prominent challenges, opportunities, hazards, and risks, but also to highlight the most promising use cases, or on the contrary, the ones associated with the least benefits compared to the risks or complexity they entail. To answer the previous questions, and therefore address this research gap, this study used a two-round Delphi questionnaire, targeting various stakeholder groups (product owners, policymakers, researchers, consultants, investors), leading to a total of 51 experts, out of which 34 also participated in the second round. In the first round, the main challenges, opportunities, and hazards facing the implementation of passenger UAM were identified. Findings on challenges and opportunities that were dependent on use cases only (as opposed to being dependent on technology or external factors) were then fed back into the second round, which helped evaluate the use cases based both on their complexities, as well as the associated benefits. Accordingly, medical/emergency was identified as the best use case and intracity transport as the worst (in terms of complexity vs. benefits). Similarly, a risk analysis evaluated the potential hazards associated with the implementation of UAM and their impacts on the system viability. Community backlash was found to be the most hazardous one, while malicious passenger behavior and improperly designed infrastructure as the least.

Yet, metropolitan regions are typically characterized by complex and dense terminal airspace structure that accommodates arrival and departure traffic from large metroplex airports. Therefore, UAM operations are expected to be initially integrated into urban airspace without interfering with conventional operations and compromising current safety and efficiency levels. This paper presents a data-driven approach to identify and predict available urban airspace that is procedurally separated from conventional air traffic towards supporting UAM integration. We use historical aircraft tracking and meteorological data to learn the spatial distribution of air traffic in the terminal airspace and create a probabilistic traffic model to predict active traffic patterns and their spatial confidence regions given current operational conditions. We demonstrate the approach for the city of Sao Paulo and its closest commercial airport, Congonhas (CGH), in Brazil. The results show that leveraging the traffic flow dynamics to allocate the urban airspace dynamically is beneficial to increase UAM accessibility by more than 5% from 3000 ft. Moreover, airspace availability is found to be highly sensitive to the applied separation requirements, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to progressively make such requirements less stringent. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air Traffic Management; Dynamic airspace management; Gaussian Mixture Model; Predictive modeling; Trajectory clustering; Urban Air Mobility"

Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a part of AAM, focused on transport passengers in low-altitude urban airspace, has attracted extensive attention among industry, government, academia, and the public. Compared to existing commercial flights, AAM operations are expected to be at higher density; thus, an AAM system needs to be scalable, safe, and autonomous. Third-party service providers are recommended for offering air traffic management and information sharing services given the anticipated high density of UAM operations. To this end, we propose an Automated Flight Planning System (AFPS) that could be employed by such service providers. In the AFPS, a Low-Altitude Airspace Management System (LAMS) is proposed to automatically generate a route network with the capability of avoiding obstacles and obstructions in low-altitude airspace. The main components of this tool are the generation of a 3D map with LiDAR data, construction of a nodal network based on the map by using the visibility graph method, and initiation of 3D shortest paths. Given the requests of flight operations, i.e., origin, destination, departure time, the Low-Altitude Traffic Management System (LTMS) will design pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories and provide flexibilities of en-route maneuvering by taking system cost and equity among operators into consideration. In this study, a flight-level assignment strategy is proposed to solve the trajectory deconfliction problem in LTMS. In addition, a Nash Social Welfare Program (NSWP) is introduced to maintain fairness among different operators if the service is provided to multiple operators of UAM. A case study of the Tampa Bay area in Florida is used to demonstrate the operability of the proposed AFPS, and animations are built to visualize the optimized conflict-free operations of UAM in the study area. © 2021 The Authors","Aerodrome; Air traffic management; Conflict-free 4D trajectory planning; Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL); Provider of service for UAM (PSU)"

One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-N-Flying (LNF), a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on the fly, and allows autonomous Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)s managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UASs as a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining (1) learning-based decision-making and (2) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UASs on a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds) and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less than 1% in the worst case, improving to near 0% in more relaxed operations.

The maneuverability is actually critical for hover and low-speed phases to perform efficient and safe flights. However, the existing assessment paradigms of the maneuverability are not applicable to eVTOL due to the diversity of the configurations, new features of the distributed electric propulsion, and insufficient empirical data. This paper proposes an optimization-based method for maneuverability assessment as an alternative to the piloted experiment approach. The methodology uses trajectory optimization to determine the achievable performance regarding specific tasks. The optimization results yield an attainable maneuverability zone (AMZ), which is essentially a four-dimensional space that reflects the maneuverability of the eVTOL. The AMZ of the exemplary eVTOL has an approximately ellipsoidal shape with the weak-spot maneuverability in the backward-upward direction. The quantitative maneuverability measure is further used in the design optimization of the propeller layout and determination of the worst-case performance by a bi-level optimization framework.

These vehicles offer urban air mobility (UAM) services using the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology. This research is the first to present a hybrid simulation goal programming (HSGP) approach to dispatch vehicles in a centralized air taxi network. After each customer drop-off, the model makes real-time decisions on (i) whether the air taxi must become idle or pick up customers, and (ii) the station to which the air taxi should be dispatched (if the air taxi is operational). The feasibility of the HSGP approach is tested using potential air taxi demands in New York City (NYC) provided by a prior study. The results of the experimentation suggest that the minimum number of air taxis required for efficient operation in NYC is 84, functioning with an average utilization rate of 66%. In addition, the impacts of commuter's “willingness to fly” rate, percentage of demand fulfillment, on-road travel limit, maximum customer wait time, and arrival distribution on the optimal number of air taxis, utilization rate, number of customers served, and cost incurred per customer are examined. Analyses show that the “willingness to fly” rate appears to have a linear influence on the number of air taxis and the efficiency, while on-road travel distance has an exponential impact on the performance measures.

In response, new technologies to meet these urban mobility demands are also rapidly maturing in preparation for future full-scale deployment. As surface congestion increases and the technology surrounding unmanned aerial systems (UAS) matures, more people are looking to the urban airspace and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) as a piece of the puzzle to promote mobility in cities. However, the lack of coordination between UAS stakeholders, federal UAS safety regulations, and researchers developing UAS algorithms continues to be a critical barrier to widespread UAS adoption. FADS takes into account federal UAS safety requirements, UAM challenge scenarios, contingency events, as well as stakeholder-specific operational requirements. FADS formalizes these requirements, through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) representations, and a trajectory planning optimization for multi-rotor UAS fleets guarantees robust and continuous-time satisfaction of the requirements and mission objectives. The intuitive FADS user interface makes it easy to plan missions in a variety of environments; we demonstrate this through several rural and urban environment-based case studies.

This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) 'flying car' concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts.

We estimate the commuter demand shift to UAM under two criteria of flexibility to travel time savings and three criteria of vertiport transfer times. Our results indicate that even for commuters with high value of time, and long transfer times at vertiports, almost forty-five percent of demand would benefit from UAM when the roads are highly congested. Even when the roads are mostly free, about three percent of the demand can benefit from UAM with the right combination of commuter flexibility and transfer times.

However, the expected traffic volumes in cities will make it impossible to operate drones in uncontrolled airspace. Despite the wealth of literature on pricing transport infrastructure usage showing that variable pricing is the optimal way for charging for road use, jurisdictions are reluctant to move towards this efficient mechanism evident in the slow uptake of road pricing implementation globally. What is worse, regulations have been drafted to tax the drone growth similarly to cars proposing the adoption of annual registration fees for drones. This paper proposes that drone use should instead adopt a pricing structure modelled on road user charging, and presents evidence suggesting that a case can be made for enabling controlled and fair growth through low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems and variable drone user charges. A stated preference experiment with 825 respondents who actively fly drones has shown user charge potential in way of willingness to pay (WTP) of A$0.11 for flying a drone for one hour. Random parameters logit models further allowed us to establish much higher WTP for various currently not permitted activities such as A$7.09 to fly beyond line of flight or A$4.29 to fly outside daylight hours. As such, if those occasional uses are variably charged, we argue that a commercially viable LAAM system could be implemented, and low altitude air traffic user charging could overtake implementation of the wider (i.e. road) transport capacity pricing on the fast lane. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Choice analysis; Road pricing for drone airspace; Transport user charges; WTP for drone flying"

We analyze the proposed airspace concepts, identify their strengths and weaknesses, point to gaps in research, and provide recommendations for a more holistic approach to designing urban airspace. We first identify the structural factors that define the size, capacity, and geometry of urban airspace. These factors are grouped into four categories: safety-related factors, social factors, system factors, and aircraft factors. Second, we review different urban airspace concepts proposed around the world. Third, we assess the airspace concepts based on the identified factors. Most of the reviewed airspace concepts are idealized as abstract networks, with an emphasis on maximizing safety and capacity, and with little regard for factors such as technological complexity, noise, or privacy. Additionally, we find that the airspace structure directly influences the level of safety, efficiency, and capacity of airspace. On the one hand, air vehicles in less structured airspace have more degrees of freedom. They can freely choose their position, altitude, heading, and speed, which increases airspace capacity and reduces flying costs. However, these concepts require high technological capabilities, such as dynamic geofences and advanced sense-and-avoid capabilities, to maintain the required safety levels. On the other hand, airspace concepts with fewer degrees of freedom can accommodate less capable aircraft but require strict operation rules and reduced capacity to ensure safety. Finally, the proposed urban air mobility concepts require extensive ground infrastructures, such as take-off and landing pads and communication, navigation, and surveillance infrastructure. There is a need for a new branch of research that analyzes urban air mobility from the perspective of urban planning, including issues around zoning, air rights, public transportation, real estate development, public acceptance, and access inequalities. © 2021 The Authors","Advanced air mobility; Airspace design; Airspace structure; Public domain; Safety-capacity tradeoff; Urban air mobility"

However, a number of challenges could impact AAM's growth potential, such as autonomous flight, the availability of take-off and landing infrastructure (i.e., vertiports), integration into airspace and other modes of transportation, and competition with shared automated vehicles. This article discusses the results of a demand analysis examining the market potential of two potential AAM passenger markets-airport shuttles and air taxis. The airport shuttle market envisions AAM passenger service to, from, or between airports along fixed routes. The air taxi market envisions a more mature and scaled service that provides on-demand point-to-point passenger services throughout urban areas. Using a multi-method approach consisting of AAM travel demand modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and constraint analysis, this study estimates that the air taxi and airport shuttle markets could capture a 0.5% mode share. The analysis concludes that AAM could replace non-discretionary trips greater than 45 min; however, demand for discretionary trips would be limited by consumer willingness to pay. This study concludes that AAM passenger services could have a daily demand of 82,000 passengers served by approximately 4000 four- to five-seat aircraft in the U.S., under the most conservative scenario, representing an annual market valuation of 2.5 billion USD. © 2021 by the authors.

Particularly, approach control around the vertiport is one of the essential issues for the safe and efficient operation of UAM, and strict safety standards are required for service in populated urban areas. In this study, the concept of holding points where multicopter aircraft can hover is introduced, and three scheduling strategies for arriving aircraft are developed and evaluated by comparing the on-time performance (OTP) with hovering time and ground time. BQA (Branch Queuing Approach), SBA (Sequence-based Approach) and, SBAM (sequence-based approach with moving circles) models are proposed and compared. BQA model prioritizes airspace safety by limiting the aircraft's travel path; SBA model allows the aircraft to move freely within the airspace and prioritizes aircraft's arrival sequence; and finally, SBAM adds the moving circle concept to the SBA model. For each model, OTP and loss of separation (LOS) risk of the proposed models are found and they are compared by simulations.

As the aerodynamic performance and flight stability characteristics can be significantly affected by multiple-propeller operation, aerodynamic analysis reflecting the power-on effect is required for design/development.

Therefore, this study evaluates the practicality of actuator methods in the aerodynamic analysis of two aircrafts with multiple propellers: a quad tilt propeller (QTP) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an optionally piloted personal air vehicle (OPPAV) of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI). The normal and side forces generated by the propellers under various angle of attack and sideslip angle conditions are found to be the most contributing factors to the deterioration in the aircraft longitudinal and directional static stabilities, respectively. The forces and moments generated by the propellers are found to make both longitudinal and directional stabilities of the QTP UAV unstable.

Among all solutions, cooperative pursuit using a team of UAVs is an effective countermeasure for unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace.

Demand data were analyzed using survey data from the commuting population and were marked on a map using MATLAB. To cluster the data, the K-means algorithm function built in MATLAB was used to select the center of the cluster as the location of the vertiports, and the accuracy and reliability of the clustering were evaluated using silhouette techniques. The locations of the selected vertiports were also identified using satellite image maps to ensure that the location of the selected vertiports were suitable for the actual vertiport location, and if the location was not appropriate, final vertiports were selected through the repositioning process.

UAM is a concept mode of transportation that is designed to bypass ground congestion for time-sensitive, price-inelastic travelers using autonomous, electric aircraft with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. This study focuses specifically on commuting trips, which are frequent and considered relatively more time-sensitive than other types of personal trips. The UAM mode's feasibility is studied using sensitivity analysis of UAM demand to cost per passenger mile and the number of vertiports placed in the region. This study also explores the spatial distribution of UAM demand in Northern California, which further helps in identifying the major commuter trip-attraction and trip-production zones for the UAM mode in the region. The results indicate that sufficient UAM demand for commuting trips can only be reached at optimistically low UAM offered fares. These fare levels could be challenging to obtain given the high real estate cost in Northern California's urban regions. Moreover, the reliability of the UAM mode must be comparable to the automobile mode; otherwise, it loses significant demand with increasing delays. The results also show that the commuting flows with promising UAM demand in Northern California are heavily one-directional, with San Francisco Financial District being a major attraction. Other types of trips should also be considered along with commuting trips to generate an economically viable system and reduce deadheading. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","On-demand mobility; Travel demand; Urban air mobility; Vertical takeoff and landing"

One of these new concepts is urban air mobility (UAM). It makes use of passenger drones for on-demand transport in urban settings, promising high travel speeds for those willing and able to pay. This research aims to answer the question how benefits from UAM will be distributed, taking into account the spatial dimension and the differential impacts on low- and high-skilled households. We develop a framework that can more generally be used to assess the welfare impacts resulting from the introduction of novel transport modes. The development of an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model building on the polycentric modelling tradition developed by Anas and co-authors allows for an analysis of mutually dependent effects on the land, labour and product markets, triggered by changes on the transport market. Allowing for an endogenous spatial structure through the introduction of agglomeration effects and an amenity-based approach, the framework investigates the relevance of the initial spatial structure for the impact of the introduction of UAM. Incorporating different skill levels of households allows to assess location choice and travel behaviour for households with different characteristics. A numerical simulation of the model shows that the different initial spatial structures impose comparable welfare changes. Variations in UAM features like marginal cost, prices, land demand for infrastructure, vertical travel speed and access and egress times have a (much) more decisive impact on modal choice and welfare effects than the initial urban structure. Simulations show that considering households of different skill levels brings additional insights, as welfare effects of UAM introduction strongly differ between groups and sometimes even go in opposing directions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agglomeration effects; Spatial equilibrium; Urban air mobility; Welfare effects"

Urban airspace is full of intrinsic risks associated with several factors, including but not limited to unpredictable microclimates, radio-frequency disturbances and electro-magnetic interferences. For safe and efficient use of airspace, it is imperative to proactively assess the availability of airspace volumes to accommodate large-scale operations. In this paper, we highlight that urban airspace is a unique environment where highly obstructed (complex topology) and sparsely structured (simple topology) regions coexist. The presence of static obstacles and required separation from those obstacles create particular spatial structures, such as narrow passages, islands and funnels, throughout the airspace. Considering that not only throughput capacity of airspace but also complexity of path planning is highly dependent on the topology of a navigable space, we propose a new airspace assessment approach to extract the topology of airspace using computational geometry techniques. We focus on identifying geospatial locations suitable for high density UAS operations as well as examining spatial contiguity between those locations in highly urbanized areas. In doing so, we define segment as an airspace region that is wide enough for multiple vehicles to simultaneously pass through. Low-altitude urban airspace is abstracted into a compact and informative graph structure called segment graph that summarizes segment connectivity in the horizontal and vertical dimension. The proposed method shows that the geometry of low-altitude airspace is fundamentally different from that of conventional high-altitude airspace and can provide a useful basis for airspace design and management within low-altitude urban environments. © 2021","Airspace assessment; Airspace design; Airspace management; Graph abstraction; Urban air mobility; UTM"

The powertrain is modeled with an empirical but comprehensive approach in order to make possible the combination with numerical optimization algorithms. In particular, the battery is modeled with an electric equivalent circuit model that includes the effect of battery aging. The fuel consumption of the turboshaft engines is calculated with a mathematical function of power request, altitude and Mach number whose coefficients are fitted by means of comparison with the commercial code Gas-turbine Simulation Program (GSP). The optimization of the energy management of the hybrid powertrain is performed in two steps.

UAM is expected to offer an alternative way of transporting passengers and goods in urban areas with significantly improved mobility by making use of low-altitude airspace. In addition to other essential elements, ground infrastructure of vertiports is needed to transition UAM from concept to operation. This study examines the network design of UAM on-demand service, with a particular focus on the use of integer programming and a solution algorithm to determine the optimal locations of vertiports, user allocation to vertiports, and vertiport access- and egress-mode choices while considering the interactions between vertiport locations and potential UAM travel demand. A case study based on simulated disaggregate travel demand data of the Tampa Bay area in Florida, USA was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Candidate vertiport locations were obtained by analyzing a three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system (GIS) map developed from lidar data of Florida and physical and regulation constraints of eVTOL operations at vertiports. Optimal locations of vertiports were determined to achieve the minimal total generalized cost; however, the modeling structure allows each user to select a better mode between ground transportation and UAM in terms of generalized cost. The outcomes of the case study reveal that although the percentage of trips that switched from ground mode to multimodal UAM was small, users choosing the UAM service benefited from significant time saving. In addition, the impact of different parameter settings on the demand for UAM service was explored from the supply side, and different pricing strategies were tested that might influence potential demand and revenue generation for UAM operators. The combined effects of the number of vertiports and pricing strategies were also analyzed.

UAM networks rely on an infrastructure of vertiports, which are closely tied to the ability of the UAM service to operate effectively. This research addresses identifying desirable locations for vertiports while taking into account vehicle limitations, desired operational strategies, and the possibility of passenger trips involving more than two vertiports. The vertiport selection problem is presented as a modified single-allocation p-hub median location problem that incorporates elements of subgraph isomorphism to create structured networks to allow for public transit operations. Because the problem is NP-hard, five heuristic algorithms are developed to find potential solutions with acceptable computation times. The methods are compared to the optimal solution in three different areas of the United States. The most effective of these methods are found to be within 10% of the optimal solution on average, and results indicate that they scale well to larger networks.

Findings on the sharing economy suggest that accommodation sharing increases long-distance travel; bikesharing is conducive to more active travel and lower car use; carsharing may reduce private car use and ownership; ridesourcing (ridehailing) may increase vehicle miles traveled; while the implications of e-scooter sharing, ridesharing, and Mobility as a Service are context-dependent.

Urban air mobility (UAM), i.e., the on-demand concept that utilizes eVTOL aircraft, might substantially reduce travel times when compared to ground-based transportation. Trips of three, pre-existent, and calibrated agent-based transport scenarios (Munich Metropolitan Region, Île-de-France, and San Francisco Bay Area) have been routed using the UAM-extension for the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) to calculate congested trip travel times for each trip’s original mode—i.e., car or public transport (PT)—and UAM. The resulting travel times are compared and allow the deduction of potential UAM trip shares under varying UAM properties, such as the number of stations, total process time, and cruise flight speed. Under base-case conditions, the share of motorized trips for which UAM would reduce the travel times ranges between 3% and 13% across the three scenarios. Process times and number of stations heavily influence these potential shares, where the vast majority of UAM trips would be below 50 km in range. Compared to car usage, UAM’s (base case) travel times are estimated to be competitive beyond the range of a 50-min car ride and are less than half as much influenced by congestion. © 2021 by the authors.

To support progress in this area, a conceptual design method for single-main-rotor and lift-augmented compound electric helicopters has been developed. The design method was used to investigate the feasible design space for electric helicopters based on varying mission profiles and technology assumptions. Within the feasible design space, it was found that a crossover boundary exists as a function of cruise distance and hover time where the most efficient configuration changes from a single-main-rotor helicopter to a lift-augmented compound helicopter. In general, for longer cruise distances and shorter hover times, the lift-augmented compound helicopter is the more efficient configuration. An additional study was conducted to investigate the potential benefits of decoupling the main rotor from the tail rotor. This study showed that decoupling the main rotor and tail rotor has the potential to reduce the total mission energy required in all cases, allowing for increases in mission distances and hover times on the order of 5% for a given battery size. © 2021 by the authors.

However, for this to materialise, the ability of accommodating high volumes of drone traffic in an urban airspace is one of the biggest challenges. For unconstrained airspace, it has been shown that traffic alignment and segmentation can be used to mitigate conflict probability. The current study investigates the application of these principles to a highly constrained airspace. We propose two urban airspace concepts, applying road-based analogies of two-way and one-way streets by imposing horizontal structure. Both of the airspace concepts employ heading-altitude rules to vertically segment cruising traffic according to their travel direction. These airspace configurations also feature transition altitudes to accommodate turning flights that need to decrease the flight speed in order to make safe turns at intersections. While using fast-time simulation experiments, the performance of these airspace concepts is compared and evaluated for multiple traffic demand densities in terms of safety, stability, and efficiency. The results reveal that an effective way to structure drone traffic in a constrained urban area is to have vertically segmented altitude layers with respect to travel direction as well as horizontal constraints imposed to the flow of traffic. The study also makes recommendations for areas of future research, which are aimed at supporting dynamic traffic demand patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

To address the environmental challenges, the proposed concepts are either hybrid-electric or all-electric vehicles enabled with propellers that rotate at lower speeds than conventional rotorcraft configurations, such as helicopters. However, the feasibility of UAM in the near future requires significant progress on the all-electric propulsion systems since current battery technology still falls short when compared with fossil fuel in terms of specific energy density. In this work, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the environmental footprint of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft for the UAM market. This methodology is applied to existing concepts for exploratory studies on mission critical performance and environmental parameters. All-electric aircraft were found to be feasible for the UAM segment from the performance perspective. However, further improvements in battery technology and electricity generation from renewable sources are required. Sustainable aviation fuels, such as Alcohol-To-Jet (ATJ) obtained from wheat straw, present a substantially lower environmental impact than conventional fuels while providing the same performance.

Moreover, an experimentally validated electrochemical-thermal (ECT) model is developed to elucidate the fast charging process and the degradation mode of UAM batteries, quantitatively capturing lithium plating during fast charging. We find that the LiBs for UAM applications are most prone to lithium plating due to their higher initial SOC required as the reserve for safety; nevertheless, the ATM method is effective in minimizing or preventing lithium plating in the high SOC range of 30-90%.

Under normal conditions, the sensored angle and the sensorless angle are weighted equally. However, in case of sensor failure, only the sensorless method is selected. In other cases, only the sensored angle is fully respected. It is assumed here that the sensored method as well as the sensorless method may fail. To determine which of the two methods is faulty, the measured current is used as a reference. The virtual current is obtained by numerically solving the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) model in the stationary frame using the rotor angles.

The handling qualities and motor current requirements of a quadcopter, hexacopter and octocopter with equal gross weights (5,360N) and total disk areas (producing a 287N/m <![CDATA[ $^2$ ]]> disk loading) are compared in hover. For axes that rely on the rotor thrust (all except yaw), the increased inertia of the larger rotors on the quadcopter increase the current requirement, relative to vehicles with fewer, smaller rotors. Both the quadcopter and hexacopter have maximum current margin requirements (relative to hover) during a step command in longitudinal velocity. In yaw, rotor inertia is irrelevant, as the reaction torque of the motor is the same whether the rotor is accelerating or overcoming drag. This, combined with the octocopter's greater inertia as well as the fact that it requires 30% less current to drive its motors in hover, results in the octocopter requiring the greatest current margin, relative to hover conditions. To meet handling qualities requirements, the total weight of the motors of the octocopter and hexacopter is comparable at 13.5% weight fraction, but the quadcopter's motors are heavier, requiring 16% weight fraction. If the longitudinal and lateral axes were flown in ACAH mode, rather than TRC mode, the total motor weight of all configurations would be nearly identical, requiring about 13.5% weight fraction for motors (compared to 7-9% weight fraction from hover torque requirements). © The Author(s), 2021.

Pioneering urban airspace design projects expect the air vehicles to fit into structured UAM corridor networks. However, most existing air transport networks are not capable of handling the increasing traffic demand, which is likely to cause congestion, traffic complexity, and safety issues. To adapt the increasing demand to the current airspace capacity, a novel macroscopic traffic assignment model is proposed to mitigate the congestion and organize the structure of air traffic flow. Firstly, the UAM corridor is designed and fitted into graph representation. Then, a traffic assignment problem based on linear dynamic system is formalized to minimize the congestion factors and the intrinsic air traffic complexity. A two-step resolution method based on Dafermos’s algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve this optimization problem. A case study is carried out on a two-layer air transport network with intensive UAM operations. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully mitigate urban airspace congestion and organize the UAM traffic into a low-complexity flow pattern.

The innovative approach used here couples the minimisation of the aircraft noise level at the certification points with the improvement of the sound quality. The latter objective represents the main novelty of the present work and is addressed using a spectral-matching approach to make the aircraft noise as close as possible to a target sound. The rationale underlying the research is the development of a community-oriented approach to the assessment airport operations in view of the complete redefinition of the future airport scenarios. Indeed, the air traffic growth, the rapid expansion of urban areas around airports, and the expected advent of urban air mobility, are transforming the aviation noise into a serious hazard to the sustainable development of society. The sound-quality-based objective imposes a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach also in the procedural optimisation, due to the detail required to estimate the noise spectrum composition. Two merit factors are minimised, specifically the EPNL at the noise certification points and the Lp-norm of the difference between the noise produced by the configuration under analysis and a target sound. The target sounds are obtained by using sound engineering techniques aimed at the sound quality improvement, on the basis of the results of the psychometric tests campaigns performed within the projects SEFA and COSMA. The minimisation is achieved adopting a global evolution method, and the results are presented in terms of approximated Pareto frontiers for a single-aisle aircraft in both takeoff and landing conditions. © 2021 Francesco Centracchio et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.","Civil Aviation; Community Noise; Multidisciplinary Optimisation; Multiobjective Optimisation; Noise Level; Sound Quality; Trajectory Optimisation"

The effort here presents a computational analysis framework to evaluate three different modes of transportation (airline, automobile, and air taxi); the air taxi service options consider different conventional takeoff and landing aircraft options powered by either conventional fuels or electricity with various levels of autonomy to assess potential advantages. The framework is developed in two variants: a specific trip model and a generic trip model. The specific trip approach leverages Google Maps and Rome2Rio application programming interfaces for driving and flight information, respectively, whereas the generic approach uses curve-fit/approximate models derived from the specific trip model for rapid calculations of trip time and cost for various system-level market studies.

An accurate vehicle simulator with realistic parameters is presented to compare in simulation the proposed architecture with a conventional underactuated VTOL vehicle that shares the same physical properties. In order to make fair comparisons, controllers are obtained solving an optimization problem in which the cost function of both systems is chosen to be equivalent.

However, with the increasing burden of expanding populations and rapid urbanization in recent decades, public transportation systems and freight traffic are suffering huge pressure, plaguing local governments and straining economies. Engineers and researchers have started to re-examine, propose, and develop the underused near-ground spaces (NGS) for transportation purposes. For instance, flying cars, which are not a totally novel idea, aim at solving the traffic congestion problem and releasing the strains on existing city transport networks by utilizing unoccupied NGS. Flying cars differ from traditional grounded transportation systems that are entirely limited by their physical space, such as trains on tracks or automobiles on roads. Flying cars do not occupy or compete for high-altitude spaces used by air traffic for long-distance transfer. As there is limited specific literature on flying cars and flying car transportation systems (FCTS), this paper aims to describe the modern advances, techniques, and challenges of FCTS.

This integration is hindered further by the separation between the traffic management problem, which has focused on a gate-to-gate flight model, and the management of connecting vehicles, crews, and passengers between flights. To help induce such integration, an accrued delay metric is used to continuously measure the delay that a flight has accumulated during the flight and inherited from previous flights through the turnaround at airports. The authors presented previously an application of this metric to mitigate the delay propagation between management initiatives during a flight. In this paper, the authors extend this metric to mitigate delay propagation through vehicle turnaround. It is first shown through a historical data analysis that this delay propagation is a significant source of delay for airline operators and that schedule padding hides some of it. Then, accrued delay along a vehicle trip is shown to mitigate some of this propagation across the network. Through an abstract, closed, three-node network example, using accrued delay is shown to help implicitly coordinate the distributed scheduling among the nodes. These nodes may represent a set of airports or a set of vertiports in an urban air mobility environment. It is shown that prioritizing flights that have accrued high delay at previous nodes significantly reduces the variance of flight delay. © 2020, AIAA International. All rights reserved.",

However, the design of such navigation systems remains not fully addressed in prior studies. Accordingly, this paper firstly presents a high-accuracy navigation system that employs Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)/ Inertial Navigation System (INS) tight integration and exploits differential GNSS corrections. Then, to protect against the potential measurement faults caused by complex signal reflections in urban environments, an Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM) framework is developed by applying multiple hypotheses solution separation to the Kalman filter-based integration architecture.

In efforts to alleviate these problems in metropolitan cities, logistics companies plan to introduce a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service called air taxis. These are electric-powered vehicles that would be tested and operated in the forthcoming years by international transportation companies like Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk. Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4.

Therefore, airspace classifications and structures need to evolve based on appropriate performance metrics, while new models and tools are needed to address UTM operational requirements, with an increasing focus on the coexistence of manned and unmanned Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles and associated Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) infrastructure. This paper presents a novel airspace model for UTM adopting Performance-Based Operation (PBO) criteria, and specifically addressing urban airspace requirements. In particular, a novel airspace discretisation methodology is introduced, which allows dynamic management of airspace resources based on navigation and surveillance performance. Additionally, an airspace sectorisation methodology is developed balancing the trade-off between communication overhead and computational complexity of trajectory planning and re-planning. Two simulation case studies are conducted: over the skyline and below the skyline in Melbourne central business district, utilising Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). The results confirm that the proposed airspace sectorisation methodology promotes operational safety and efficiency and enhances the UTM operators’ situational awareness under dense traffic conditions introducing a new effective 3D airspace visualisation scheme, which is suitable both for mission planning and pre-tactical UTM operations. Additionally, the proposed performance-based methodology can accommodate the diversity of infrastructure and vehicle performance requirements currently envisaged in the UTM context. This facilitates the adoption of this methodology for low-level airspace integration of UAS (which may differ significantly in terms of their avionics CNS capabilities) and set foundations for future work on tactical online UTM operations. © 2020 by the authors.

From safety perspective, integrity is the most important navigation performance criterion because it measures the trust that can be placed in the correctness of the navigation output. Through leveraging the concept of integrity, this paper develops an integrity monitoring framework to protect visual navigation system against misleading measurements and to quantify the reliability of the navigation output.

Therefore, considering the essentially dynamic rate of change in this type of environment, integrity monitoring is of critical importance for understanding the level of trust we have in positioning and timing data. In this paper, the dilution of precision (DOP) coefficients under nominal and challenging conditions were investigated for the purpose of integrity monitoring in urban environments. By analyzing positioning information in a simulated urban environment using a software-based GNSS receiver, the integrity monitoring approach based on joint consideration of GNSS observables and environmental parameters has been proposed. It was shown that DOP coefficients, when considered together with a number of visible satellites and cut-off elevations specific to the urban environment carry valuable integrity information that is difficult to get using existing integrity monitoring approaches.

This demand-responsive nature of MoD poses a challenge for optimally scheduling vehicles, and it has attracted much attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of research in the MoD scheduling literature: a homogeneous fleet is assumed, but it is not necessarily true all the time. Hence, this article proposes a novel formulation of the scheduling problem for UAM with a heterogeneous fleet and presents particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm that utilize a greedy algorithm to keep solutions feasible. The proposed algorithms are implemented with a model-predictive control scheme to effectively manage the demand-responsive nature. As a result, the proposed algorithms can find a near-optimal solution in a short time. Using the algorithms, a numerical experiment with six different fleet mixes is conducted, and impacts of fleet heterogeneity are analyzed.

This paper contributes to this topic by providing an analysis of different urban flying car scenarios by using an agent-based approach with different traffic conditions. The preliminary results obtained on some test networks and focusing on travel cost effects suggest that the expected advantages the flying car will depend on trip origin/destination points, average distances travelled in the urban contexts and the location of transition nodes, which are introduced as interchange nodes between aerial and ground mode. © 2020 by the authors.","Flying cars; Software agents; Traffic management; Transportation network; Urban air mobility (UAM)"

Air taxis will provide on-demand transportation for individual needs. They will also connect important transportation nodes, such as airports and city centers, as well as providing quick transfers between train stations or a convenient option for crossing rivers and lakes. It is hoped that UAM will help meet today's political targets of sustainability and decarbonization. However, there are certain threats that could impede the sustainable and thus successful introduction of UAM to our cities, with noise being a prominent limitation. This paper argues that citizens have to be viewed as stakeholders in urban air transportation, regardless of whether they or not intend to use it, and that a concept of resident participatory noise sensing (PNS) will be beneficial to the implementation of UAM. Web-based services and smartphones facilitate the access and updating of current information about local noise distributions, thus enabling them to be used to foster UAM in smart cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Acceptance; Air taxi; Noise annoyance; Participatory noise sensing; Smartphone; Transportation; Urban air mobility"

To enable this growth safely and efficiently, the CORUS project has developed a concept of operations for drones flying in Europe in very low-level airspace, which they have to share that space with manned aviation, and quite soon with urban air mobility aircraft as well. U-space services and the development of smart, automated, interoperable, and sustainable traffic management solutions are presented as the key enabler for achieving this high level of integration. In this paper, we present the U-space concept of operations (ConOps), produced around three new types of airspace volume, called X, Y, and Z, and the relevant U-space services that will need to be supplied in each of these.

However, despite a growing interest in UAM, understanding users’ perceptions to it remains limited. This research aims to identify and quantify the factors affecting the adoption and use of UAM, based on relevant tools from the literature, such as recurring factors in studies on aerial vehicle concepts, ground autonomous vehicles, but also acceptance models, such as the Technology Acceptance Model by Davis et al. (1989). A stated-preference survey was developed to assess the perception of users in terms of adoption time horizon, including options such as the first six years of the service's implementation, “unsure”, and “never”. The obtained results were evaluated using exploratory factor analyses, and the specification and estimation of suitable discrete choice models, multinomial logit models (MNLs) and ordered logit models (OLMs), with adoption time horizon as dependent variable. Findings revealed the importance of safety and trust, affinity to automation, data concerns, social attitude, and socio-demographics for adoption. Factors, such as the value of time savings, the perception of automation costs, and service reliability, were also found to be highly influential. There was also an indication that skeptical respondents, i.e. answering “unsure”, had a behavior similar to late and non-adopters, i.e. adoption time horizon higher than six years or answering “never”.

In this paper, a novel UAM airspace design concept has been proposed to separate arrival air traffic of wingless EVTOL aircraft from winged EVTOL aircraft until merging at the metering fix. Two separate vertiport arrival procedures have also been proposed for the problem based on anticipated UAM traffic density in emergent (low) and early expanded (moderate/high) operations, as proposed by NASA. The objective of the problem is to minimize the makespan (landing completion time) of a given set of EVTOL aircraft. A heuristic approach called insertion and local search combined with two different scheduling methods called 1) mixed-integer linear programming and 2) time advance are proposed to minimize the makespan of the mixed fleet of EVTOL aircraft. Next, the impact of the number of landing pads N on the makespan is studied to aid in early expanded UAM operations. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to see the impact of the following on the sequencing and scheduling algorithms: 1) the number of EVTOL aircraft expected to land n and 2) the number of EVTOL aircraft used in the local neighborhood search k. Through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis, our algorithms demonstrated real-time scheduling capabilities; therefore, they can be potentially used for on-demand UAM arrival operations. © 2020, AIAA International.

Stimulated by recent technological progress and increasing regulatory clarity especially larger cities are anticipated to use drones for parcel and passenger transport hoping to relieve congested inner city traffic. Despite it is first and foremost the urban population that would be affected by accessing lower airspace, only few studies addressed the public perception of using transport drones. Aiming to fill the gap of attitudinal and acceptance research in the context of drones, the article embraces the subject by presenting qualitative results of a series of five focus groups conducted in three German cities. The analysis of discussions shows that participants were largely ambivalent towards the use of drones, putting special emphasis on a variety of object-related factors (safety and security, sustainability, usefulness), subject-related factors (general perception of technology) and also context-related factors (potential societal implications of drone technology). Framed by a discussion of identified acceptance factors in the context of the present scientific debate and assessing drones' potential social implications the article provides a profound qualitative exploration into one of the most disruptive and controversial future technologies that may transform both the transport world and urban societies. © 2020 Universidad de Valladolid.

A conceptual design and optimization tool for urban air mobility, including vehicle, mission, and cost models, is presented in this paper. The tool uses geometric programming, a class of optimization problems with extremely fast solve times and for which global optimality is guaranteed. The tool is used to conduct a study of urban air mobility from a vehicle design perspective. Vehicle configurations with a higher lift-to-drag ratio, but a higher disk loading, generally weigh less and cost less to operate. The battery and the pilot are identified as the two main cost drivers; strategies for reducing these two costs are discussed. A case study is conducted on New York City airport transfers; trip times and costs are compared with those of current helicopter air taxi operations and with car ride-sharing. Sensitivity analyses are presented with respect to reserve requirements, mission range, and battery energy density.

A threshold for selection is presented, applied and validated for both scales. The results included a list of indicators for assessing the potentials of UAM integration to existing public transportation systems; the chosen indicators were then compared against existing ones for sustainable urban mobility.

However, successfully bringing such vehicles and airspace operations to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume. Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level-k model in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment. Numerical experiment results over several case studies, including the roundabout test problem, show that the proposed computational guidance algorithm has promising performance even with the high-density air traffic case. © 2020 by Xuxi Yang and Peng Wei.",

However, this airspace currently contains complex legacy airspace structure and flight operations that are perceived as safe, efficient, and generally acceptable to the overflown public. Hence, air traffic management concepts to support these emerging operators may be constrained to cause little to no interference with legacy operations. The identification of airspace that is noninterfering and potentially “available” to these new operators is therefore a critical first step toward their integration. This paper introduces a geometric airspace assessment approach that considers seven features of airspace that may preclude these new operations (that is, airspace constructs). Four hypothetical air traffic management scenarios are developed that prescribe different degrees of integration. An alpha-shape topological method is refined to process geometrically complex airspace construct polygons over an expansive geographic area and develop three-dimensional mappings of airspace availability. The approach is demonstrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and is readily extensible to other locations. It is envisioned to be useful in identification of viable takeoff and landing sites; evaluation of the sensitivity of airspace availability to separation or trajectory conformance requirements; and flight route design, throughput estimation, and risk analysis. © 2020by Vishwanath Bulusu, Parker Vascik, Valentin Polishchuk, and Jungwoo Cho.",

This work provides a framework to enable optimal and efficient on-demand eVTOLs arrivals in the context of on-demand urban air mobility.

With the emergence of urban air mobility, it is important to consider consumer perceptions of autonomous air taxis and passengers’ willingness to fly in various conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine what external factors may influence consumers’ willingness to fly on autonomous air taxis in various weather conditions, terrain, flight time, and population densities. Methods: Across two studies, 782 participants were presented with a definition of autonomous air taxis. Then a hypothetical scenario involving an air taxi that included four variables: rain versus no rain (Weather), 5-minute flight versus 30-minute flight (Flight Time), over land or water (Terrain), and over urban or rural areas (Population Density). Results: The data from the study suggest that both United States and Indian passengers were more willing to fly in good weather conditions versus rainy weather, over land versus over water, and on short flights versus longer flights. Conclusions: As urban air mobility becomes more well-known, it is important to understand consumer opinions and educate them on emerging technology.

We present results for optimizations with and without stall and acceleration constraints, with varying levels of flow augmentation from propellers, and find that the optimal takeoffs involve stalling the wings or flying near the stall angle of attack. However, we find that the energy penalty for avoiding stall is practically negligible. Additionally, we find that without acceleration constraints, the optimized trajectories involve rapidly transitioning to forward flight and accelerating, followed by climbing at roughly constant speed, and then accelerating to the required cruise speed. With an acceleration constraint for passenger comfort, the transition, climb, and acceleration phases are more gradual and less distinct.

The MIDAS project, funded in the frame of the Clean Sky 2 program, aims to satisfy those recent requirements with an ADS certified for commercial applications. The main pillar lays on a smart fusion between COTS solutions and analytical sensors (patented technology) for the identification of the aerodynamic angles. The identification involves both flight dynamic relationships and data-driven state observer(s) based on neural techniques, which are deterministic once the training is completed. As this project will bring analytical sensors on board of civil aircraft as part of a redundant system for the very first time, design activities documented in this work have a particular focus on airworthiness certification aspects. At this maturity level, simulated data are used, real flight test data will be used in the next stages. Data collection is described both for the training and test aspects. Training maneuvers are defined aiming to excite all dynamic modes, whereas test maneuvers are collected aiming to validate results independently from the training set and all autopilot configurations. Results demonstrate that an alternate solution is possible enabling significant savings in terms of computational effort and lines of codes but they show, at the same time, that a better training strategy may be beneficial to cope with the new neural network architecture. © 2019 by the authors.

Furthermore, we draw a conclusion dependent on the systemic product character, which enforces different learning requirements concerning supply chain position and, as an overarching conclusion, we identify product structure to be decisive for how organizational learning should be styled. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerospace; Ambidexterity; Automotive; Complex product systems; Industry convergence; Industry evolution; Knowledge evolution; Open innovation; Technological evolution; Technological learning"

These regulations restrict unmanned aircraft (UA) from flying over people and their operation to within visual line of sight (VLOS). However, as new applications for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are discovered, their capabilities improve, and regulations evolve, there is an increasing desire to undertake urban operations, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and surveillance. This built environment poses new weather hazards that include enhanced wind shear and turbulence. The smaller physical dimensions, lower mass and reduced ground speed of UA make them more susceptible to these hazards than their manned counterparts and can have a significant impact on their performance, endurance and the likelihood of accomplishing the mission. Due to current restrictions, very few flight hours have been accumulated confronting these unique weather challenges. In the absence of this data, this article explores a diverse body of literature that analyzes urban flow and discusses the relevant insight it provides to sUAS operations. © 2019, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.",

Therefore, we introduce the dynamic airspace sectorisation and consequently change this paradigm to the more appropriate approach of ‘structure follows flow’. The dynamic airspace sectorisation allows an efficient allocation of scarce resources considering operational, economic and ecological constraints in both nominal and variable air traffic conditions. Our approach clusters traffic patterns and uses evolutionary algorithms for optimisation of the airspace, focusing on high capacity utilisation through flexible use of airspace, appropriate distribution of task load for air traffic controllers and fast adaptation to changed operational constraints. We thereby offer a solution for handling non-convex airspace boundaries and provide a proof of concept using current operational airspace structures and enabling a flight-centric air traffic management. We are confident that our developed dynamic airspace sectorisation significantly contributes to the challenges of future airspace by providing appropriate structures for future 4D aircraft trajectories taking into account various operational aspects of air traffic such as temporally restricted areas, limited capacities, zones of convective weather or urban air mobility. Dynamic sectorisation is a key enabling technology in the achievement of the ambitious goals of Single European Sky and Flightpath 2050 through a reduction in coordination efforts, efficient resource allocation, reduced aircraft emissions, fewer detours, and minimisation of air traffic delays. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Airspace; Clustering; Controller task load; Dynamic sectorisation; Evolutionary algorithm"

This paper investigates potential operational constraints that could arise during the implementation or scale-up of a UAM system. Literature on helicopter passenger networks was reviewed to determine operational constraints experienced by prior services similar toUAM. A constraint analysis was applied to near-term UAM operations in Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas to assess if the historical constraints persist, or if novel constraints have emerged. The three city cases represented geographically diverse implementation regions for UAM services. A notional door-to-door concept of operations was applied to 32 reference missions within the three city cases. The reference missions exhibited a variety of requirements in terms of flight distance, passenger volume, market type, population overflight, and air traffic congestion, among others. By reviewing ground and flight operations for each reference mission, eight operational constraints were identified that could limit UAM system growth potential or prohibit UAM services altogether. The three most stringent constraints concerned community acceptance of aircraft noise, takeoff and landing area availability, and air traffic control scalability. © 2018 by Parker Vascik.",
